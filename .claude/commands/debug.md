Help me debug this issue systematically:

1. **Reproduce**: Confirm you understand how to trigger the bug
2. **Hypothesize**: List 3-5 possible causes, ranked by likelihood
3. **Investigate**: Check each hypothesis (logs, code inspection, tests)
4. **Root cause**: Identify the actual issue
5. **Fix**: Implement the solution
6. **Verify**: Prove it's fixed
7. **Prevent**: Should we add a test? Update CLAUDE.md lessons learned?

Issue: $ARGUMENTS
