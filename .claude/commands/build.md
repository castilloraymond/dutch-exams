description: Implement an approved plan systematically
---

We have an approved plan. Implement it with discipline:

1. Review the plan first—confirm you understand each phase
2. Work through phases sequentially
3. After each phase:
   - Verify it works (run tests, check manually)
   - Commit with a meaningful message
   - Brief status update to me
4. If anything is unclear or the plan seems wrong, STOP and discuss
5. Don't skip edge cases or error handling to save time
