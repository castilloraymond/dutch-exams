description: Code review with teaching focus
---

Review this code as a senior engineer teaching a junior:

## What's Good
Patterns and practices to repeat.

## Issues (by severity)
1. Critical: [breaks things]
2. Important: [causes problems later]
3. Minor: [style/convention]

## Why It Matters
Explain the reasoning—I'm learning.

## Concrete Fixes
Show me exactly what to change.

## Concepts to Study
Terms or patterns I should research deeper.

Be direct. I want to improve, not feel good.

Focus: $ARGUMENTS
