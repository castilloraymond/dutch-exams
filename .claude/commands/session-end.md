description: Clean wrap-up of work session
---

Wrapping up this session:

1. **Commit check**: Any uncommitted work? Commit or stash it.
2. **Progress summary**: What did we accomplish?
3. **Lessons learned**: Anything to add to CLAUDE.md?
4. **Next session**: What should I pick up next time?
5. **Blockers**: Any open questions or research needed?

Write a brief session summary I can reference next time.
