description: Create a detailed implementation plan before any coding
---

Act as a senior software architect. DO NOT write any code yet.

For the task I describe, create a comprehensive plan:

## 1. Problem Statement
Restate what we're solving in your own words.

## 2. Clarifying Questions
Ask 5-10 questions before proceeding. Cover:
- User requirements and edge cases
- Technical constraints
- Integration points
- Success criteria

## 3. User Stories
Who does what, why, and what's the expected outcome?

## 4. Technical Approach
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Files to create/modify (with purposes)
- Data flow (ASCII diagram if helpful)
- Dependencies needed
- Edge cases and how to handle them

## 5. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests needed
- Integration tests
- Manual verification steps

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
Specific, measurable conditions for "done."

## 7. Risks & Unknowns
What could go wrong? What needs research?

## 8. Implementation Phases
Break into logical chunks that can be committed independently.

---

After I answer your questions, refine this plan into a document at `docs/plans/[feature-name].md`. Only proceed to implementation after I explicitly approve.
