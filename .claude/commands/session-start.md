description: Start a focused work session
---

Starting a new work session. Help me focus:

1. **Context refresh**: Review CLAUDE.md priorities and last 5 commits
2. **What's in progress?**: Check for uncommitted changes or stashed work
3. **Session goal**: Ask me what I want to accomplish today
4. **Plan**: Break the goal into concrete steps
5. **Blockers**: Anything I need to resolve first?

Let's make this session count.
