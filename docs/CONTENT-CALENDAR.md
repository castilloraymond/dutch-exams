## Theme 2: Strategy & Study Plans

Actionable content for time-poor professionals. These articles answer "how do I actually prepare?" and convert readers into users.

| # | Title | Target Keyword | Priority | Week |
|---|-------|---------------|----------|------|
| 9 | The 30-Day Inburgering Study Plan for Busy Professionals | inburgering study plan / inburgering 30 days | High | 1 |
| 10 | How Long Does It Take to Prepare for the Inburgering Exam? | how long to prepare inburgering | High | 3 |
| 11 | The 20-Minute-a-Day Method: How to Pass Inburgering Without Quitting Your Job | inburgering while working / inburgering study schedule | Medium | 6 |

| 14 | Failed the Inburgering Exam? Here's Your Retake Strategy | failed inburgering exam / inburgering retake | Medium | 16 |

### Content notes
- The 30-day study plan (#9) should be a downloadable/printable week-by-week breakdown — this is link-bait and highly shareable.
- "How long to prepare" (#10) targets one of the most searched questions. Answer range: 4–12 weeks depending on existing Dutch level, with a clear framework for self-assessment.
- "Failed" article (#14) is high-empathy, low-competition — few resources address retake strategy specifically.

---

## Theme 3: Legal & Administrative

The bureaucracy content. Expats are drowning in conflicting information about rules, deadlines, and registration. Accurate, clear guides here build enormous trust.

| # | Title | Target Keyword | Priority | Week |
|---|-------|---------------|----------|------|
| 15 | Inburgering Exam Costs in 2026: Full Breakdown of Fees and Hidden Expenses | inburgering exam costs / inburgering price | High | 2 |
| 16 | How to Register for the Inburgering Exam: A Step-by-Step Guide to Mijn Inburgering | inburgering exam registration / how to register inburgering | High | 4 |

| 20 | Inburgering vs NT2: Which Exam Do You Actually Need? | inburgering vs NT2 / NT2 exam | High | 15 |
| 21 | Where to Take the Inburgering Exam: Locations, Availability, and Booking Tips | inburgering exam locations / where to take inburgering | Low | 19 |

### Content notes
- Costs article (#15) should include a comparison table: Wi2013 vs Wi2021 costs, retake fees, and optional expenses (courses, tutors, materials).
- Registration guide (#16) is step-by-step with DigiD instructions — many expats struggle with the Dutch-only registration portal.
- Wi2013 vs Wi2021 (#17) is the single most confusing topic for expats. A clear decision tree here will become a top-linked resource.
- Exemptions (#19) catches search traffic from people who may not need the exam at all — but they'll bookmark the site for people who do.

## Theme 4: Dutch Society & Culture (KNM Content)

Turn the 8 KNM themes into blog content. This serves double duty: it's genuinely useful study material AND it ranks for long-tail searches about Dutch society.

| # | Title | Target Keyword | Priority | Week |
|---|-------|---------------|----------|------|
| 22 | Dutch Healthcare for Expats: How the System Works (and What KNM Tests You On) | Dutch healthcare system expats / KNM gezondheid | High | 5 |

| 24 | Housing in the Netherlands: Tenant Rights, Social Housing, and What's on the KNM | Dutch housing rights / renting Netherlands expat | Medium | 10 |

| 28 | DigiD, BSN, and Digital Life in the Netherlands: KNM Essentials | DigiD expats / BSN Netherlands | High | 20 |
| 29 | Dutch History and Geography on the KNM: Key Facts You Need to Know | Dutch history KNM / Netherlands geography exam | Low | 22 |

### Content notes
- Each article blends practical expat information with explicit KNM exam prep — e.g., "Here's how the healthcare system works in practice, and here's what the KNM specifically tests."
- Healthcare (#22) and DigiD (#28) are the highest-traffic opportunities because expats search for these topics regardless of whether they're preparing for KNM.
- Include 3-5 sample KNM questions at the end of each article with a CTA to practice more on the platform.

## Theme 5: Language Skills & Tips

Practical Dutch language content focused on exam performance, not general fluency.

| # | Title | Target Keyword | Priority | Week |
|---|-------|---------------|----------|------|
| 30 | A2 Dutch: What Does It Actually Mean and How Good Do You Need to Be? | A2 Dutch level / what is A2 Dutch | High | 6 |

| 35 | Common Dutch Grammar Mistakes That Cost You Points on the Schrijven Exam | Dutch grammar mistakes / schrijven exam tips | Low | 23 |

### Content notes
- "A2 Dutch" (#30) is critical — it reframes difficulty. Most professionals overestimate what's required and delay starting.
- Vocabulary list (#31) is highly shareable and saveable. Format as a table with Dutch word, English translation, and example context.
- Speaking practice (#34) naturally leads to the platform's text-to-speech features.

- "30% ruling ending" (#38) targets a highly anxious, highly motivated segment. The 30% ruling phase-out creates urgency. This is timely, emotional, and highly shareable.
- Partner article (#40) is a unique angle — many professional expats have a partner who also needs to pass. Practical advice on studying together.

## Theme 7: Mistakes, Myths & Mindset

Myth-busting and confidence-building. These perform well on social media and tend to get shared in expat groups.

| # | Title | Target Keyword | Priority | Week |

- Tutor article (#44) is a fair comparison — some people benefit from tutors for speaking. Position the platform as complementary for everything else.

- "Free resources" (#49) is a traffic magnet. Be genuinely helpful — list DUO practice exams, free tools, community resources — then position the platform as the structured alternative.
- "What I wish I knew" (#48) is a personal-voice piece. Works well shared on Reddit and LinkedIn.

4. **Strengthen winners** — Top-performing articles get expanded, internal links added, and FAQ sections updated.
5. **Prune losers** — Low-performing articles get rewritten with better angles or consolidated into stronger pieces.
