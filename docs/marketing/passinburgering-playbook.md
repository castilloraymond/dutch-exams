# PassInBurgering.com — Revised Growth Playbook

## Updated positioning: the exam prep platform for busy professionals

Your customer is NOT the price-sensitive obligated integrator. Your customer is the **30% ruling kennismigrant** — a senior software engineer, a consulting partner, a fintech PM — who earns €80K+ and views the inburgering exam as a checkbox standing between them and permanent residence or a Dutch passport. They don't want the cheapest option. They want the **fastest, most efficient, highest-confidence path to passing** — ideally with zero wasted time and zero awkward tutor dynamics.

This changes everything about the messaging, the channels, and the content.

**Core positioning statement:** PassInBurgering is the most efficient way for busy professionals to pass the Dutch inburgering exam. Practice anywhere, anytime, at your own pace — no scheduling, no tutors, no wasted time.

**Key messaging pillars:**
1. **Efficiency** — "Pass in 30 days studying 20 minutes a day" not "free practice tests"
2. **Overpreparer confidence** — "Know exactly what's on the exam" not "basic study help"  
3. **Tech-first** — "AI-powered practice that adapts to you" not "online worksheets"
4. **High-stakes reassurance** — "Your PR/citizenship depends on this. Be ready." not "pass your integration requirement"
5. **No scheduling friction** — "Practice at midnight after the kids are asleep" not "book a lesson"

BRAND POSITIONING (apply to ALL content)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

WHO WE SERVE:
High-income expat professionals in the Netherlands — typically 30% ruling kennismigranten — who need to pass the inburgering exam for permanent residence (PR) or Dutch citizenship. They are:
- Cash-rich, time-poor (€80K–200K+ earners, demanding jobs, often young families)
- Achievement-oriented — they're used to passing exams and want to overprepare
- Tech-forward — they prefer a well-designed app/platform over sitting with a tutor
- Pragmatic — they see inburgering as a high-stakes checkbox, not a passion project
- Frustrated by inefficiency — they don't want to waste 3 months in a group class designed for A1 learners when they're already at A2

WHAT WE ARE:
The most efficient way to prepare for the inburgering exam. A tech-first platform with practice exams, text-to-speech pronunciation, and structured study plans. Currently free during early access (building the product and community), with premium features coming.

WHAT WE ARE NOT:
- Not a charity or free-forever tool (don't lead with "free" as the main value prop)
- Not a language school replacement (we're exam prep, like Kaplan is for the GMAT)
- Not for absolute beginners who need A0→A2 language instruction
- Not a tutor marketplace

TONE AND VOICE:
- Confident, competent, slightly informal — like a senior colleague who already passed the exam giving you the cheat codes
- Never patronizing or overly encouraging ("You can do it!" is not our vibe)
- Practical and direct — respect the reader's intelligence and time
- Empathetic to the absurdity of the Dutch bureaucratic process without being bitter
- Light humor welcome — the inburgering process has plenty of material
- Mirror the language of tech professionals: "optimize," "efficient," "structured," "high-confidence"

NEVER SAY:
- "100% free" or lead with price as the differentiator
- "immigrants" (say "expats" or "professionals" or "internationals")
- "integration requirement" in a way that sounds like a burden (frame it as "the path to PR/citizenship")
- Anything that positions users as struggling or disadvantaged
- "Easy" — position it as achievable with the right preparation, not easy

ALWAYS CONVEY:
- This exam has real stakes (PR, citizenship, your future in NL depends on it)
- Smart preparation beats brute-force studying
- The exam changed significantly in 2025 — outdated prep materials are dangerous
- Tech-first practice is more efficient than classroom instruction for exam prep
- You can fit this into a busy schedule (20 min/day is enough with the right approach)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
CORE KNOWLEDGE BASE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IS INBURGERING?
The Dutch civic integration process. Completing it earns an inburgeringsdiploma, required for permanent residence (PR) and Dutch citizenship/naturalization.

WHO MUST INBURGER:
- Asylum status holders / refugees (obligated)
- Family reunification visa holders (obligated)
- Non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizens living long-term in NL (obligated)
OUR PRIMARY AUDIENCE — voluntary integrators:
- Kennismigranten (highly skilled migrants, 30% ruling holders) who do NOT have to inburger but CHOOSE to for PR or citizenship
- They take the old-law (Wi2013) exam at A2 level, which is more straightforward
EXEMPT from obligation: EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, holders of qualifying Dutch diplomas (MBO-2+, HBO, WO), certain Turkish citizens (Ankara Agreement)

TWO LEGAL FRAMEWORKS:
1. Wet inburgering 2013 (Wi2013): For anyone with a residence permit obtained BEFORE January 1, 2022, AND for voluntary integrators (kennismigranten seeking PR/citizenship). Requires A2 level. Exam components: Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking, KNM, ONA.
2. Wet inburgering 2021 (Wi2021): For obligated integrators with permit AFTER January 1, 2022. Requires B1 level. Municipality creates a PIP. Three routes: B1-Route, Education Route, Self-Reliance Route (Z-route). MAP replaces ONA. PVT required.

IMPORTANT FOR OUR AUDIENCE: Most kennismigranten fall under Wi2013 rules and take the A2 exam, regardless of when they decide to integrate. This is a key insight most people don't know.

A2 LEVEL (what our audience needs):
- ~1,000–2,000 word vocabulary
- 150–200 study hours total (but efficient prep can compress this significantly)
- Present tense + simple past tense
- Can handle routine social exchanges
- Higher pass rates than B1

EXAM COMPONENTS (A2/Wi2013):
1. Reading (Lezen) — 25 multiple-choice questions, 65 minutes, pass: 18/25
2. Listening (Luisteren) — 25 MC with audio fragments, 45 minutes, pass: 19/25
3. Writing (Schrijven) — pen and paper, fill forms + short messages, 40 minutes
4. Speaking (Spreken) — CHANGED MARCH 2025: 16 spoken-answer exercises, 35 min, 4 sections. No more multiple choice. All answers spoken into a computer microphone.
5. KNM (Kennis van de Nederlandse Maatschappij) — OVERHAULED JULY 2025: 40 MC questions, 45 min, pass: 28/40 (70%). Now factual knowledge (no more video scenarios). 8 themes across 4 life areas. New topics: DigiD, digital safety, Holocaust, women's rights, Keti Koti, Eid al-Fitr, mental health, POH (praktijkondersteuner huisarts).
6. ONA (Oriëntatie op de Nederlandse Arbeidsmarkt) — portfolio + 30-min interview with 2 DUO interviewers about career orientation in NL. Cost: €40. Alternative: 64 hours of ONA course.

EXAM COSTS:
- Reading: €50, Listening: €50, Writing: €50, Speaking: €50, KNM: €50, ONA: €40
- Total: €290 for Wi2013 (what our audience pays)

REGISTRATION:
- Via Mijn Inburgering portal (inburgeren.nl) using DigiD
- Locations: Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Rijswijk, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Zwolle
- Book 4–8 weeks in advance (slots fill up)
- Results: 2–3 weeks after exam

TIMELINE FOR KENNISMIGRANTEN:
- No mandatory deadline (voluntary), but can't apply for PR until all exams passed
- PR requires 5 years continuous residence + completed inburgering
- Citizenship requires 5 years + inburgering + renunciation of previous nationality (with exceptions)
- Strategic tip: start preparing ~6 months before your 5-year mark

COMMON MISTAKES OUR AUDIENCE MAKES:
1. Underestimating KNM — "I live here, I know Dutch society" → KNM tests specific factual knowledge (what is DigiD? how does the healthcare referral system work? what are your rights as a tenant?)
2. Not knowing about the 2025 format changes — studying with pre-July 2025 KNM materials is dangerous
3. Skipping speaking practice — the March 2025 format removed multiple choice, making it pure oral production
4. Waiting too long — "I'll do it when I need it" → then scrambling before PR application
5. Assuming B1 is required — most kennismigranten only need A2

COMPETITORS (reference factually when relevant):
- DUO official practice (inburgeren.nl) — free but very limited, no structured learning path
- InburgeringOnline.nl — ~€9/month subscription, video-based
- Inburgering.org — large question bank, subscription model
- NT2 Taalmenu — Dutch-only interface, government-funded
- Language schools (Direct Dutch, Koentact, Language Corner) — €1,000–3,000+, group classes
- Private tutors — €30–60/hour, scheduling required, chemistry issues

OUR ADVANTAGE vs. competitors: Designed specifically for exam prep (not general Dutch learning). Updated for 2025 format changes. Practice anytime (no scheduling). Tech-first UX. No tutor dependency.

# PART 2: Camera-free Instagram / TikTok strategy for a professional audience

## Why faceless works even better for THIS audience

Your target audience — busy professionals — actually responds better to information-dense, product-focused content than personality-driven creator content. They don't have time to develop parasocial relationships with influencers. They want the answer fast. Faceless, product-led content respects their time.

The proven model: **Gizmo AI** ran 30+ faceless TikTok accounts accumulating 70M+ views and $59K MRR — all showing close-ups of their flashcard app in action. No faces. No voices. Just the product solving a problem. That's your template.

## Five camera-free content formats, ranked by effort-to-impact

### Format 1: Screen recording quiz walkthroughs (your #1 format)

**What it is:** Record yourself using passinburgering.com — answering a KNM question, taking a practice test, using text-to-speech. Add captions and a text hook. That's it.

**Why it works:** It's a product demo disguised as educational content. Viewers see exactly what the platform does. It's also the easiest content to produce — you're literally just using your own product.

**Production workflow (~10 min per video):**
1. Open passinburgering.com on desktop or phone
2. Start CapCut screen recording (or QuickTime on Mac → import to CapCut)
3. Navigate to a KNM practice question. Pause. Select an answer. Show the result.
4. Import into CapCut → add text hook at the top ("Can you pass this Dutch exam question?") → add auto-captions → trim to 15–30 seconds → export
5. Post to TikTok + IG Reels + YT Shorts

**10 specific videos to make:**
1. "I tried a real KNM practice question — can you get it right?" (show question → pause → answer)
2. "The new KNM exam tests you on THIS" (show a question about the Holocaust or Keti Koti — topics people don't expect)
3. "This is what inburgering speaking practice looks like" (demo the text-to-speech feature)
4. "3 minutes of reading exam practice — follow along" (screen record a full reading exercise)
5. "How I practice for inburgering during my lunch break" (phone screen recording, casual)
6. "The question that trips up 70% of people" (show a tricky KNM question)
7. "A2 vs B1 — see the actual difference" (show an A2 question then a B1 question side by side)
8. "What the listening exam actually sounds like" (play an audio fragment from practice)
9. "I answered 10 KNM questions in 5 minutes — here's my score" (speed run format)
10. "This feature saved me hours of study time" (demo a specific platform feature)

### Format 2: Text-on-screen fact cards

**What it is:** Bold text over stock footage of Dutch scenery. Each video delivers one surprising or useful fact. No face, no voice needed — just text + trending audio.

**Why it works for professionals:** Fast to consume, highly saveable, works on mute (how most professionals scroll during work breaks).

**Production workflow (~5 min per video):**
1. Open Canva → TikTok/Reels template → choose a clean, modern design
2. Download 5–10 seconds of Dutch stock footage from Pexels (search: "Amsterdam," "Netherlands office," "cycling Netherlands," "Dutch architecture")
3. Layer bold text with the fact/tip on top
4. Add trending audio in CapCut or directly in the TikTok app
5. Export and post

**10 specific videos:**
1. "The inburgering exam costs €290. Here's the breakdown." (text per exam component)
2. "You do NOT need B1 to get permanent residence. Here's what you actually need." (most powerful myth-bust for our audience)
3. "The KNM exam changed in July 2025. If you're using old materials, you're studying the wrong thing."
4. "The speaking exam removed all multiple choice in March 2025. Here's the new format."
5. "Most kennismigranten start preparing too late. Here's the ideal timeline." (6 months before 5-year mark)
6. "You can take the ONA interview instead of a 64-hour course. Here's how."
7. "Exam slots book up 4–8 weeks in advance. Don't wait."
8. "A2 Dutch = ~2,000 words. That's less vocabulary than a 5-year-old." (reframe difficulty)
9. "Your inburgering result expires if you don't use it for naturalization within X years: FALSE." (correct a common misconception)
10. "The hardest part of inburgering isn't the Dutch — it's the bureaucracy." (relatable hook → exam registration tips)

### Format 3: "Study with me" / timed practice sessions

**What it is:** Screen recording of timed practice on the platform, with a timer overlay and lo-fi/focus music. No face or voice.

**Why it works:** StudyTok is massive. But more importantly, this format is *functional* — viewers actually practice along. This drives them to the platform.

**Production:** Record 3–5 minutes of practice. Speed it up to 60 seconds for the reel. Add a timer overlay in CapCut. Add study-vibe background music.

### Format 4: Comparison carousels (Instagram-first)

**What it is:** Multi-slide Instagram carousels comparing things visually. Swipeable, saveable, shareable.

**Why it works for professionals:** Carousel posts get 3x the engagement of single images on Instagram. They're information-dense. They get saved. Professionals share them with their partner who also needs to inburger.

**10 carousel ideas:**
1. "A2 vs B1: Which do YOU need?" (side-by-side comparison slides)
2. "Old KNM format vs New KNM format" (what changed in July 2025)
3. "Inburgering exam: all 6 components explained in 6 slides"
4. "30-day study plan" (one week per slide, daily tasks)
5. "Top 10 KNM topics ranked by how often they appear on the exam"
6. "The inburgering timeline: from start to PR application"
7. "Tutor vs Self-study vs Platform: which is right for you?"
8. "5 mistakes that make you fail the speaking exam"
9. "What you need for PR vs Citizenship — side by side"
10. "Inburgering vocabulary: 20 words you MUST know for KNM"

### Format 5: AI avatar "exam coach" (optional — invest after traction)

Use D-ID ($5.90/month) or HeyGen to create a consistent "exam coach" character who delivers tips in English. This adds a human element without requiring you on camera.

**Only worth doing once you've validated that Formats 1–4 get traction.** The avatar adds production overhead and doesn't necessarily outperform pure product/text content for a professional audience.

## Posting cadence and hashtags

**Frequency:** 5x/week minimum (1 per day on weekdays). Cross-post everything to TikTok + IG Reels + YT Shorts simultaneously.

**Hashtag strategy:**
- TikTok (4–6): #inburgering #dutchexam #expatnetherlands #learndutch #30ruling #livinginholland
- Instagram (15–20, in first comment): #inburgering #inburgeringsexamen #expatlife #netherlands #learndutch #dutchlanguage #knmexam #30percent #expatprofessional #movingtonetherlands #dutchlife #amsterdamexpat #permanentresidence #dutchcitizenship #studydutch #langaugelearning #techinnetherlands #internationalsinNL
- LinkedIn (3–5): #inburgering #expatlife #netherlands #30ruling #dutchcitizenship

**Best posting times for professional expats in NL:**
- 7:30–8:30 AM CET (commute scroll)
- 12:00–1:00 PM CET (lunch break)
- 8:00–9:30 PM CET (post-dinner wind-down)

# PART 3: Revised community & forum strategy

## The communities your audience actually uses

30% ruling professionals don't hang out in refugee support forums. They're in:

### Tier 1 — High engagement (daily/every other day)

**r/Netherlands** (~500K members)
The single most active place where kennismigranten ask about inburgering, PR, and citizenship. Search "inburgering" or "permanent residence" — there's a new relevant thread almost daily.

Playbook:
- Your persona: a knowledgeable professional expat who's been through the process
- Target threads about: PR applications, citizenship questions, "do I need to inburger?", exam prep questions, 30% ruling expiring
- Week 1–2: only answer, no links. Establish credibility with detailed, accurate replies.
- Week 3+: mention passinburgering.com when someone specifically asks about practice resources, max 1–2x per week
- Example comment for a "how to prepare for inburgering" thread:

> The biggest thing most people don't realize is that kennismigranten take the A2 exam, not B1. That's a massive difference — A2 is roughly 2,000 words and basic grammar, which most people who've lived here a few years already half-know.
>
> The exam that catches people off guard is KNM — it was completely redesigned in July 2025. The old video-based format is gone. Now it's 40 factual multiple-choice questions about how Dutch society works (healthcare referrals, tenant rights, DigiD, education system, etc.). If you've been studying with pre-2025 materials, you're preparing for the wrong exam.
>
> For practice, I've been using passinburgering.com — it has the updated KNM format and I can squeeze in practice sessions between work. The speaking exam also changed in March 2025 (no more multiple choice, pure spoken answers), so make sure whatever you use covers the new format.

**r/learndutch** (~50K members)
More study-focused. Great for sharing specific tips about exam components. Your persona here: someone methodically preparing for the exam alongside work.

**Facebook: "Expats in Amsterdam" (30K+), "Expats in The Hague" (44K), "International Newcomers Amsterdam"**
These are where 30% ruling expats cluster. Inburgering questions pop up weekly. Same rules: answer first, mention platform when directly relevant.

### Tier 2 — Weekly engagement

**InterNations Netherlands chapters**
InterNations skews heavily toward professional expats. The forums and events are where your exact audience discusses life admin. Become active in the Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague chapters.

**LinkedIn**
Not a community to "engage in" like Reddit, but THE platform for positioning PassInBurgering.com as a professional-grade tool. Post 1–2x per week with thought-leadership angles:
- "I've been helping expat professionals prepare for the inburgering exam. Here's the #1 thing everyone gets wrong."
- "The Dutch inburgering exam just changed. Here's what 30% ruling holders need to know."
- "Passing the inburgering exam is a career decision. Here's why, and how to do it efficiently."

**Expat.com Netherlands Forum**
Active for process questions. The audience here is broader (not just professionals), but PR/citizenship threads attract your demographic.

**IamExpat.nl**
Comments on inburgering articles. Also get listed in their service directory.

### Tier 3 — Monthly engagement

**Quora** — Answer inburgering questions. Quora answers rank in Google, providing passive SEO value.

**DutchReview, DutchNews.nl comments** — Add value to articles about integration policy.

**Discord: Learn Dutch servers** — Lower-priority, but occasionally relevant.

## The 90/10 rule for all communities

90% of your engagement should be genuinely helpful answers with zero mention of your platform. 10% can include a natural reference. If anyone ever feels like you're "promoting," you've failed. The goal is to be the person other users tag when someone asks an inburgering question.

---

# PART 4: Revised 30-day action plan

## Before Day 1 — setup (2–3 hours)

- **System prompt**: Paste the Part 1 prompt into Claude/Cowork. Test with: `BLOG: KNM exam 2025 changes` and `REDDIT: r/Netherlands — "I'm a kennismigrant, do I need B1 or A2 for inburgering?"`
- **Social accounts**: Create IG, TikTok, YouTube with consistent professional branding. Bio: "Pass your inburgering exam — efficiently. Practice exams for busy professionals 🇳🇱 → passinburgering.com"
- **Reddit**: Create or prep your personal Reddit account. Join r/Netherlands, r/learndutch, r/expats, r/Amsterdam.
- **Tools**: Canva, CapCut, ElevenLabs free accounts. Bookmark Pexels.
- **Google**: Set up Search Console + GA4. Submit sitemap.

### Communities

Maintain rhythm: 4–6 Reddit comments/week (max 2 with site mention), 2–3 forum answers, 1 LinkedIn post.

**Day 30: Post a transparent Reddit thread on r/Netherlands or r/learndutch:**
"I built a practice platform for the inburgering exam — looking for feedback from people who are preparing"
Be genuine. Share your story (built this because the exam process is needlessly confusing, especially for professionals). Ask for real feedback. This approach consistently outperforms stealth marketing on Reddit.

### Social

Continue daily posts. Introduce one new format: a "3 things I learned preparing for inburgering this week" series — positions the account as a relatable journey, not a brand account.
