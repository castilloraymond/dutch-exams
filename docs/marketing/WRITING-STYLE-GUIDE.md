## Brand Voice

### Who We Sound Like

A **senior colleague who already passed the exam giving you the cheat codes.** Not a teacher. Not a brand. Not a chatbot. A real person who went through the same process, figured out the shortcuts, and is now telling you exactly what to do — efficiently and without fluff.

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute   | 1 (Low)           | ← Our Range →     | 5 (High)           |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Formality   | Slang, casual      | **2–3** Relaxed professional | Academic, corporate |
| Authority   | Guessing           | **4** Confident, specific | Lecturing           |
| Warmth      | Cold, transactional | **3** Friendly but not gushy | Over-encouraging   |
| Humor       | Dry, none          | **2–3** Light, situational | Comedy-first       |
| Complexity  | Oversimplified     | **2–3** Clear, no jargon | Dense, academic     |
| Urgency     | No pressure        | **3–4** Real stakes, not panic | Fear-mongering     |

### Before / After Examples

**Blog intro:**
- Before: "In today's fast-paced world, navigating the Dutch inburgering process can feel overwhelming. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know."
- After: "The KNM exam was completely redesigned in July 2025. If you're studying with old materials, you're preparing for the wrong test. Here's what actually changed and how to adjust."

**CTA:**
- Before: "Sign up now for our amazing free platform and start your journey today!"
- After: "The practice exams are free during early access. 20 minutes a day is enough — try a KNM set tonight."

**Social caption:**
- Before: "Exciting news! We're thrilled to announce our new speaking practice module. Check it out!"
- After: "The speaking exam killed multiple choice in March 2025. Every answer is now spoken. Here's what the new format looks like."

**Error state / empty state:**
- Before: "Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later."
- After: "That didn't load. Refresh the page or try a different browser — your progress is saved."

## Audience Language

### Terminology Rules

| Instead of...                  | Say...                              | Why                                              |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| immigrants                     | expats, professionals, internationals | Our audience identifies as expats, not immigrants |
| integration requirement        | path to PR/citizenship              | Positive framing — it's a step, not a burden     |
| easy                           | achievable with the right prep      | Respect the effort; don't trivialize              |
| 100% free / completely free    | free during early access            | Price isn't our value prop; build perceived value |
| students                       | professionals, learners             | They're not students — they have careers          |
| users                          | you (direct address)                | Personal, not clinical                            |
| integration course             | exam prep                           | We're Kaplan, not a language school               |
| basic / beginner               | A2-level                            | Specific, not condescending                       |

### Mirror Words

Use language our audience uses naturally. These words signal "this was written for someone like me":

- optimize, efficient, structured, streamlined
- high-confidence, overprepare, pass rate
- time-poor, busy schedule, between meetings
- PR, citizenship, 30% ruling, kennismigrant
- tech-forward, self-paced, on-demand

### Topics That Always Resonate

These six pillars (from the playbook's ALWAYS CONVEY) connect with our audience every time:

1. **Real stakes** — PR, citizenship, your future in NL depends on this
2. **Smart prep beats brute-force** — strategy over hours
3. **2025 format changes** — outdated materials are dangerous
4. **Tech-first is more efficient** — better than classroom for exam prep
5. **Fits a busy schedule** — 20 min/day is enough with the right approach
6. **Kennismigrant-specific** — A2 not B1, Wi2013 not Wi2021

## AI Content Humanizer — 3-Filter System

Run every AI-generated draft through these three filters before publishing. Apply in order.

### Filter 1: Variety

Break the AI rhythm. AI text defaults to uniform sentence length and predictable patterns.

- **Vary sentence length.** Follow a long sentence with a short one. Then a medium one. Mix it up.
- **Change starters.** If two consecutive sentences start the same way, rewrite one.
- **Break patterns.** If every paragraph is 3 sentences, make one 1 sentence and another 5.
- **Mix sentence types.** Statements, questions, fragments. "The result? A 15% higher pass rate."
- **Check the first word of each paragraph.** If more than two start with "The" or "This" — rewrite.

### Filter 2: Voice

Make it sound like a person wrote it, not a language model.

- **Use contractions.** "You're" not "You are." "Don't" not "Do not." "It's" not "It is."
- **Add personal touches.** "I bombed the first practice KNM set" > "Practice tests may initially seem challenging."
- **Use casual phrases.** "Here's the thing," "spoiler alert," "the short answer is," "honestly."
- **Direct address.** "You" over "one" or "learners" or "many people."
- **Add qualifiers a human would.** "Most people," "in my experience," "roughly," "around."
- **Break the fourth wall.** "Yes, this matters even if you think your Dutch is fine."

### Filter 3: Flow

Remove the telltale AI connective tissue.

- **Remove transitional crutches.** Delete "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally," "In conclusion" — just start the next point.
- **Simplify vocabulary.** "Use" not "utilize." "Get" not "obtain." "Help" not "facilitate."
- **Cut hedge phrases.** "It is worth noting that" → delete. "It should be mentioned that" → delete. Just say the thing.
- **Break long sentences.** If a sentence has more than one comma-separated clause, split it into two.
- **Read it aloud.** If it sounds like a textbook, rewrite it. If it sounds like something you'd say to a colleague at lunch, ship it.

## Banned Words & Phrases

### AI Transition Words — Delete on Sight

| Delete this           | Replace with                     |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Furthermore           | *(just start the next sentence)* |
| Moreover              | *(just start the next sentence)* |
| Additionally          | Also / And / Plus                |
| In conclusion         | *(just start the final point)*   |
| Consequently          | So                               |
| Nevertheless          | But / Still                      |
| Nonetheless           | But / Still                      |
| Henceforth            | From now on                      |
| Subsequently          | Then / After that                |
| In light of this      | Because of this / Given this     |
| It is important to note | *(delete — just state the fact)* |
| It should be mentioned | *(delete — just state the fact)* |
| In today's world      | *(delete entirely)*              |

### AI Filler Phrases — Delete Entirely

These add zero information. Cut them and the sentence improves:

- "It's important to note that..."
- "It's worth mentioning that..."
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "In order to..." (just say "to")
- "The fact of the matter is..."
- "It goes without saying..."
- "Needless to say..."
- "As a matter of fact..."
- "For all intents and purposes..."
- "In terms of..."

### AI Vocabulary — Replace

| utilize       | use                   |
| facilitate    | help / enable         |
| optimize      | improve *(unless talking to our audience about study strategy — then "optimize" is fine)* |
| implement     | set up / build / do   |
| comprehensive | complete / full       |
| robust        | strong / solid        |
| streamline    | simplify              |
| endeavor      | try / effort          |
| aforementioned | *(name the thing again or say "this")* |
| paradigm      | approach / model      |
| synergy       | *(delete or rephrase)* |
| innovative    | new / better          |
| cutting-edge  | latest / modern       |
| game-changing | *(describe the specific benefit instead)* |
| landscape     | space / world / field |
| journey       | process / experience *(unless literal travel)* |
| empower       | help / give you       |
| navigate      | get through / handle *(unless literally navigating a website)* |
| deep dive     | closer look           |
| unpack        | explain / break down  |
| holistic      | full / complete       |
| elevate       | improve               |

### Overclaiming Phrases — Fix, Don't Delete

| Overclaim            | Fix instruction                                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| game-changer         | Describe the specific benefit instead                 |
| revolutionary        | Say what's actually new                               |
| the best             | Be specific: "highest pass rate" or "most questions"  |
| guaranteed           | Only if there's a literal money-back guarantee        |
| everything you need  | List what's actually included                         |
| the only             | "One of few" unless literally the only one            |
| never before         | Verify the claim; rephrase as "new" or "first"        |

## Blog Conventions

### Frontmatter Format

Every blog post uses this exact YAML format (matches `BlogPostMeta` in `lib/blog.ts`):

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title Here — With Year if Relevant"
slug: "your-post-title-here"
description: "150–155 chars. Primary keyword + value prop + CTA hint."
date: "2026-MM-DD"
author: "PassInBurgering"
keywords: ["primary keyword", "secondary keyword", "long-tail variant"]
---
```

### Structure Rules

| Element          | Rule                                                       |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Title            | 55–60 chars. Primary keyword near front. Include year when relevant. |
| Meta description | 150–155 chars. Primary keyword + value prop.               |
| H1               | Matches or closely mirrors the title.                      |
| Opening          | Answer the core question in 2–3 sentences (featured snippet). Then a "why this matters for your PR/citizenship" hook. |
| H2 sections      | 4–7 per post. Descriptive, question-based when possible.   |
| H3 sub-sections  | Use within H2s when a section has 2+ distinct sub-points.  |
| Paragraphs       | Max 3–4 sentences. Break early rather than late.           |
| Bold             | Key facts, numbers, dates, exam scores.                    |
| Tables           | Use for comparisons (A2 vs B1, old vs new format, costs).  |
| FAQ section      | 3–5 questions, structured for FAQ schema.                  |
| Internal links   | 2–4 per post, linking to other blog posts or app pages.    |
| CTA              | Natural, once per post. Frame as efficiency gain.          |

## Maintenance

### When to Update This Guide

- **Voice evolves:** If user feedback or analytics suggest the tone needs adjustment
- **New AI slop patterns:** When new AI-generated phrases become recognizable, add them to the banned list
- **Format changes:** When `BlogPostMeta` interface changes in `lib/blog.ts`, update the frontmatter section
- **New content types:** When adding a new playbook mode, add a row to the Content Types Reference

### Relationship Map

```
This Style Guide ──────► Playbook system prompt (voice + tone rules)
                 ──────► Content Brief template (references this for quality standards)
                 ──────► Blog posts (frontmatter format, SEO checklist, humanizer)
```

The style guide is the **source of truth for voice.** The playbook operationalizes it for LLM content generation. The content brief references it for quality standards. All three must stay in sync.
