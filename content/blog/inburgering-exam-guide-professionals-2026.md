# The Professional's Guide to Passing the Inburgering Exam in 2026

You moved to the Netherlands for a great job. You've got the 30% ruling, you're settled in, and life's good. Then someone at a borrel mentions "inburgering" and you think: *wait, does that apply to me?*

Here's the thing -- most kennismigranten don't realize that while inburgering isn't mandatory for them, it's **the single fastest path to permanent residence and Dutch citizenship**. And if you're planning to stay long-term, skipping it isn't really an option.

This guide breaks down everything you need to know about the inburgering exam in 2026: what's on it, what changed recently, and how to pass it efficiently without blowing up your schedule. No fluff, no filler -- just the stuff that actually matters.

## What Is Inburgering and Do You Actually Need It?

Inburgering (civic integration) is the Dutch government's way of making sure people living in the Netherlands understand the language and society. It consists of **five language exams plus a society knowledge exam**, all administered by DUO (Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs).

Now here's where it gets interesting for kennismigranten on the 30% ruling: **you're exempt from the mandatory inburgering requirement**. The government doesn't force you to integrate. You won't get fined for not doing it.

But -- and this is a big but -- if you want **permanent residence (PR)** or **Dutch citizenship**, you need to pass these exams. There's no way around it.

So the real question isn't "do I need to do inburgering?" It's "do I want to stay in the Netherlands long-term?" If the answer is yes, you need to start planning.

**The bottom line:**

| Situation | Inburgering Required? |
|---|---|
| Kennismigrant staying < 5 years | No |
| Kennismigrant applying for PR | **Yes** |
| Kennismigrant applying for citizenship | **Yes** |
| Spouse/partner of kennismigrant | Usually yes (mandatory) |
| EU/EEA/Swiss nationals | No |

One thing to flag: your **spouse or partner** who came to the Netherlands on a dependent visa likely *does* have a mandatory inburgering requirement with a deadline. That's a separate situation with real consequences (fines, visa issues), so don't confuse the two.

## Wi2013 vs. Wi2021: Which Law Applies to You?

This is the part that trips up almost everyone, and it's arguably the most important thing in this entire guide.

There are **two different inburgering laws** in the Netherlands:

- **Wi2013** (Wet inburgering 2013) -- applies to people who arrived or became inburgering-plichtig before January 1, 2022
- **Wi2021** (Wet inburgering 2021) -- applies to people who arrived on or after January 1, 2022

Here's the key insight: **as a kennismigrant applying voluntarily, you almost certainly fall under Wi2013**, regardless of when you arrived. Wi2021 primarily applies to people with a mandatory inburgering obligation who got their residence permit after January 1, 2022.

Why does this matter? Because the requirements are different:

| | Wi2013 | Wi2021 |
|---|---|---|
| **Language level** | **A2** | B1 (with A2 fallback route) |
| **Exam format** | Separate exams at DUO | Learning route via municipality |
| **KNM exam** | Yes | Yes (integrated differently) |
| **ONA requirement** | Yes | Part of learning route |
| **How you study** | Self-study or private course | Usually assigned a learning route |

**A2 is significantly more achievable than B1.** We're talking roughly **1,000-2,000 words** of vocabulary and basic conversational ability. If you're already living in the Netherlands, speaking some Dutch at the supermarket, and reading signs -- you're closer than you think.

Spoiler alert: most kennismigranten who've lived here for a couple of years and put in structured study time pass A2 without major drama.

If you're unsure which law applies to your situation, check with DUO directly or call the Informatie Beheer Groep. Don't rely on forum posts from 2019 -- the rules have changed.

## What Are the 5 Exam Components?

The inburgering exam under Wi2013 has **six components total**: five exams plus ONA. Let's break each one down so you know exactly what you're walking into.

### 1. KNM (Kennis van de Nederlandse Maatschappij)

This is the Dutch society knowledge exam. As of the **July 2025 overhaul**, it's **40 factual multiple-choice questions** covering topics like healthcare, education, housing, politics, history, geography, and Dutch norms and values.

You've got **45 minutes**. The questions are in Dutch, but at a simpler reading level than the Lezen exam. Most questions test whether you know how things work in the Netherlands -- like what to do when you're sick, how the school system works, or what the Tweede Kamer is.

The good news: this is pure knowledge. No language production required. If you can read A2-level Dutch and you've studied the material, you'll pass. The topics are predictable and well-defined.

### 2. Lezen (Reading)

The reading exam tests your ability to understand written Dutch at A2 level. You'll read short texts -- signs, emails, ads, letters, simple articles -- and answer multiple-choice questions about them.

Think of it this way: if you can read a letter from your gemeente or understand a basic email from your landlord, you're in the right ballpark. The texts aren't literary Dutch; they're practical, everyday stuff.

### 3. Luisteren (Listening)

Similar to Lezen, but with audio. You'll hear short recordings of conversations, announcements, or phone calls and answer multiple-choice questions. The speakers talk at a natural pace, but the vocabulary is A2 level.

This is the exam where most people either feel totally fine or completely lost. If Dutch audio sounds like white noise to you right now, start training your ear early. If you can follow a basic conversation at the bakker, you're already in good shape.

### 4. Schrijven (Writing)

The writing exam asks you to produce short written texts: filling out forms, writing a short email, replying to a message. It's not essay writing -- it's practical, structured writing.

You'll be typing on a computer, and you're graded on whether you communicated the required information clearly. Perfect grammar isn't expected at A2. Getting the message across is what counts.

### 5. Spreken (Speaking)

Here's one that changed significantly. As of **March 2025**, the Spreken exam **no longer has any multiple-choice components**. It's **pure spoken answers** now. You'll sit in front of a computer, see prompts on screen, and record your spoken responses.

The four parts test different speaking skills: repeating sentences, describing pictures, answering questions about everyday topics, and responding to situations. It's all recorded and graded later by examiners.

This is the exam that makes most people nervous, but here's the thing: A2 speaking is *basic*. You don't need to be eloquent. You need to be understood. Short, clear sentences beat long, mangled ones every time.

### 6. ONA (Orientatie op de Nederlandse Arbeidsmarkt)

This isn't a traditional exam -- it's a portfolio requirement. You need to demonstrate that you've oriented yourself on the Dutch job market. As a kennismigrant who's already working, this is usually straightforward. You'll document things like understanding your employment contract, knowing your rights as an employee, and basic knowledge of the Dutch labor market.

Don't overthink ONA. It's a checklist, not a hurdle.

## What Changed in 2025? (And Why It Matters for 2026)

Two major changes hit in 2025, and if you're prepping in 2026, you need to know about both.

### KNM Overhaul -- July 2025

The KNM exam got a significant redesign. The old format had scenario-based questions that were often vague and debatable. The new format is **40 factual multiple-choice questions** -- cleaner, more straightforward, but covering a wider range of topics.

**What this means for you:** older study materials and practice exams are partially outdated. The topics are the same (healthcare, education, housing, etc.), but the question style is different. Make sure any practice materials you use reflect the post-July 2025 format.

You can [practice KNM questions in the new format here](/learn/knm).

### Spreken Overhaul -- March 2025

The speaking exam was redesigned to remove all multiple-choice elements. Previously, some sections had you choose the "best" response. Now it's 100% spoken production.

**What this means for you:** you can't guess your way through Spreken anymore. You need to actually practice speaking Dutch out loud. But at A2 level, the bar is reasonable -- you're not debating politics, you're telling someone you can't make it to a meeting.

### Why These Changes Matter

Both changes push in the same direction: **less memorization, more actual ability**. That's honestly better for you as a professional. You don't want to waste time gaming a weird exam format. You want to build real (if basic) Dutch skills and prove you have them. The updated exams are more aligned with that goal.

The flip side: **retaking any exam costs around 350 euros and comes with a months-long wait for a new appointment**. DUO exam slots book up fast. Failing isn't just expensive -- it's a massive time sink. This is why you want to overprepare rather than wing it.

## How Do You Prepare Efficiently?

You're a professional. You've optimized processes, hit deadlines, and probably overprepared for job interviews. Apply that same energy here. The inburgering exam isn't hard -- it's a project with a defined scope and clear success criteria.

### Estimate Your Starting Point

Before building a study plan, figure out where you are. If you've been living in the Netherlands for two or more years and pick up some Dutch passively, you're probably already at A1 level. That means you need to bridge from A1 to A2 -- which is very doable.

If you're starting from absolute zero, budget more time. But the A2 bar is still within reach for any motivated professional.

[Take a quick diagnostic assessment](/try) to see where you stand across all five exam areas.

### The 20-Minute-Per-Day Framework

Here's a structured approach that works for busy professionals:

**Weeks 1-4: Foundation**
- **10 min/day** -- Dutch vocabulary app or flashcards (aim for 15-20 new words/day)
- **10 min/day** -- KNM topic reading (one topic per week)
- **Weekend** -- one full practice exam section

**Weeks 5-8: Practice**
- **10 min/day** -- [Reading practice with real exam-style passages](/learn/lezen)
- **10 min/day** -- [Listening practice with Dutch audio](/learn/luisteren)
- **Weekend** -- full mock exam under timed conditions

**Weeks 9-12: Polish and Test**
- **20 min/day** -- focus entirely on your weakest area
- **Weekend** -- full mock exams, review mistakes
- **Book your exam** in week 10 for week 13-14

That's **roughly 150-200 hours of total study** spread over 3-4 months at a sustainable pace. Some people do it faster, some slower. The key is consistency, not marathon sessions.

### Focus on Your Weak Spots

Most kennismigranten have a natural advantage in certain areas. If you work in an international company but still hear some Dutch around the office, your listening is probably better than your writing. If you read Dutch news occasionally, your reading is ahead of your speaking.

Don't spend equal time on everything. **Identify your two weakest components and allocate 60% of your study time there.** The other areas just need maintenance.

### Mock Exams Are Non-Negotiable

You wouldn't go into a client presentation without a dry run. Same principle here. **Take at least 3-4 full mock exams** before the real thing, under timed conditions.

Mock exams do two things: they reveal knowledge gaps you didn't know you had, and they eliminate exam-day anxiety. When you've already done the format five times, the sixth time (the real one) is just another rep.

### Aim for 80%, Not 60%

The official pass threshold is **60%**, but that's the bare minimum. Aim for **80% or higher** on your mock exams. Why? Because exam-day nerves, unfamiliar question phrasing, or one bad section can easily shave 10-15% off your score. Give yourself a margin.

## When Should You Start Preparing?

This depends on when you plan to apply for PR or citizenship.

**For permanent residence:** you can apply after **5 years** of continuous legal residence. The inburgering exams need to be passed *before* you submit your PR application. Factor in DUO's scheduling timeline -- you might wait **2-3 months** for an exam slot after booking.

**Recommended timeline:**

| Milestone | When |
|---|---|
| Start studying | **12-8 months** before PR application |
| Take diagnostic/mock exams | **6-5 months** before |
| Book DUO exam appointments | **5-4 months** before |
| Take exams | **3-2 months** before |
| Receive results | **1-2 months** before |
| Submit PR application | Target date |

**Why start 12 months out?** Because if you fail one component, you need time to rebook and retake. DUO doesn't let you retake immediately. With a **350 euro retake fee** and a multi-month wait for a new slot, you want a buffer.

The worst-case scenario is passing 5 out of 6 components and then waiting 4 months to retake the one you failed -- pushing your entire PR application back. Don't let that happen. Start early and overprepare.

If you're thinking about citizenship (which requires PR first in most cases), add another 1-2 years to the overall timeline and factor in any additional requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I take the inburgering exam in English?

No. All exams are in Dutch. The KNM exam questions are written in simpler Dutch than a newspaper, but they're still in Dutch. There's no English-language option and no interpreter allowed.

### How much does the inburgering exam cost?

Each exam component costs around **50-60 euros** to book through DUO. A full first attempt across all components runs roughly **300-350 euros total**. Retakes are the expensive part -- each retake costs the same per component, and you only retake the ones you failed. But with scheduling delays, the real cost is time, not money.

### I've lived here 10 years but never did inburgering. Is it too late?

Not at all. There's no deadline for voluntary inburgering. Whether you've been here 2 years or 15, you can take the exams whenever you're ready. In fact, having lived in the Netherlands for a long time gives you a passive advantage -- you've absorbed more Dutch than you realize.

### Do online courses work, or do I need a classroom?

Both work. Plenty of kennismigranten pass through self-study and online resources alone. The advantage of a classroom course is structure and speaking practice with real humans. The advantage of self-study is flexibility and efficiency -- you focus on what *you* need, not what the class is covering that week.

For most professionals, a hybrid approach works best: structured online materials for reading, listening, and KNM, combined with a conversation partner or italki tutor for speaking practice.

### What happens if I fail one part?

You only retake the part you failed -- your passes on other components stay valid. But retake slots at DUO book up fast, and you'll wait **2-3 months minimum** for a new appointment. Each retake costs the full exam fee for that component. This is exactly why aiming for 80% on your mock exams matters -- you want to pass everything on the first attempt.
