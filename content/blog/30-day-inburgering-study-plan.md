You've been putting off the inburgering exam for months. Maybe years. You know you need it for permanent residence, but between work, social life, and the sheer confusion of the Dutch bureaucratic system, studying keeps falling to the bottom of the list.

Here's what nobody tells you: **you don't need six months to prepare.** Most professionals who actually sit down and follow a structured plan pass all six components in 30 days of focused study. Not 30 days of quitting your job. Not 30 days locked in a room. Just 30 days of consistent, targeted practice — about 1 to 2 hours per day.

This is that plan.

<div class="stat-number">30 days</div>
<div class="stat-label">Average prep time for professionals who pass all 6 components on their first attempt</div>
</div>

## Who This Plan Is For

This plan assumes you're a working professional — probably a kennismigrant or expat — with at least a basic grasp of Dutch. You don't need to be fluent. If you can order coffee in Dutch and read a simple email from your gemeente, you have enough foundation.

You'll need:
- **1 to 2 hours per day** on weekdays
- **2 to 3 hours** on weekends
- Access to practice exams (that's where [our platform](/learn) comes in)
- A quiet spot where you can practice speaking out loud without your roommates judging you

If your Dutch is truly at zero, add 2 to 4 weeks of basic language study before starting this plan. Apps like Duolingo or Babbel work fine for getting to a baseline.

## The 6 Components You Need to Pass

Before we dive into the schedule, let's be clear about what you're preparing for. The inburgering exam has six components, and you need to pass **all of them**:

| Component | What It Tests | Difficulty | Time in Exam |
|-----------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Lezen (Reading) | Reading Dutch texts and answering questions | A2 | ~35 min |
| Luisteren (Listening) | Understanding spoken Dutch | A2 | ~30 min |
| Schrijven (Writing) | Writing short Dutch texts (emails, forms) | A2 | ~35 min |
| Spreken (Speaking) | Speaking Dutch in everyday situations | A2 | ~15 min |
| KNM (Society Knowledge) | Dutch laws, customs, and practical knowledge | N/A | ~45 min |
| ONA (Orientation) | Career/education orientation portfolio | N/A | Portfolio |

<div class="takeaway-box">
<strong>Key takeaway:</strong> The language exams (Lezen, Luisteren, Schrijven, Spreken) are all at A2 level — the second-lowest level on the European scale. You don't need to be good at Dutch. You need to be <em>A2-level good</em>, which is much more achievable than most people think.
</div>

The ONA (Oriëntatie op de Nederlandse Arbeidsmarkt) is a portfolio you build over time, not a sit-down exam. We're not covering it in this 30-day plan because it's a separate process. Focus on the five sit-down exams first.

## Week 1: Foundation (Days 1–7)

**Goal:** Get comfortable with all exam formats. No deep study yet — just understanding what you're walking into.

**Daily breakdown:**

**Days 1–2: KNM orientation**
- Take a [KNM practice exam](/learn/knm/exam) without studying. Just see how you score
- Read through the 8 KNM topic areas. Note which ones feel familiar (healthcare, work, law) vs. totally foreign (political system, history)
- Don't memorize yet. Just map the territory

**Days 3–4: Reading and Listening**
- Do one full [Lezen practice set](/learn/lezen/exam) — note which question types trip you up
- Do one full [Luisteren practice set](/learn/luisteren/exam) — can you follow the conversations at natural speed?
- If listening is hard, start watching Dutch news (NOS Journaal) with subtitles for 15 minutes daily

**Days 5–6: Writing and Speaking**
- Try one [Schrijven task](/learn/schrijven) — writing an email or filling out a form
- Try one [Spreken task](/learn/spreken) — record yourself and listen back
- These are the components where practice matters more than knowledge

**Day 7: Assessment and planning**
- Review your practice scores across all modules
- Rank the 5 components from strongest to weakest
- Your weakest 2 components get priority time in weeks 2 and 3

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro tip:</strong> Most professionals score highest on KNM (you already know how Dutch society works from living here) and lowest on Spreken (speaking under pressure is a different skill than casual Dutch). Plan accordingly.
</div>

## Week 2: Targeted Study (Days 8–14)

**Goal:** Deep practice on your weakest areas. Maintenance on your strongest.

**Daily structure (weekdays):**
- 30 minutes: Weakest component (intensive practice)
- 30 minutes: Second weakest component
- 15 minutes: Quick KNM topic review (one topic per day)

**Weekend structure (Saturday + Sunday):**
- Take one full [mock exam](/learn/lezen/select) in your weakest component
- Take one full mock exam in your second weakest
- Review every wrong answer. Understand *why* you got it wrong

### Reading (Lezen) Tips for This Week

If reading is a weak spot, the bottleneck is almost always vocabulary, not grammar. Focus on:
- **Signpost words** — words like *echter* (however), *daarom* (therefore), *bovendien* (besides) that tell you the structure of a passage
- **Question types** — the exam mostly asks "what is the main point?" and "what does this detail mean?" Practice identifying main ideas quickly
- Read the questions *before* the passage. This changes everything

### Listening (Luisteren) Tips for This Week

- Play audio at normal speed first. Only slow down if you catch less than 50%
- Focus on **context clues** — you don't need every word, just the gist
- Practice with [our listening exercises](/learn/luisteren/exam) that match the actual exam format

### Writing (Schrijven) Tips

- Learn the 5 email templates: formal request, complaint, cancellation, response, and form completion
- Dutch email conventions: start with "Geachte" (formal) or "Beste" (semi-formal), end with "Met vriendelijke groet"
- Practice filling out forms — this is free points if you've memorized the common fields (naam, adres, geboortedatum, BSN)

### Speaking (Spreken) Tips

- Record every practice session. Your phone's voice recorder is fine
- The exam has 4 parts: reading a text aloud, describing a situation, responding to a question, and having a short conversation
- Speed doesn't matter. Clarity does. Speak slowly and clearly

## Week 3: Mock Exam Week (Days 15–21)

**Goal:** Simulate real exam conditions. Build stamina and confidence.

This is the most important week. You're not learning new material — you're training your brain to perform under exam conditions.

**Daily structure:**
- Take one full mock exam per day, rotating through components
- Strict timing — use a timer, no pausing
- Score yourself honestly
- Spend 30 minutes reviewing mistakes

**Suggested rotation:**

| Day | Mock Exam | Target Score |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| Mon (Day 15) | KNM | 80%+ |
| Tue (Day 16) | Lezen | 70%+ |
| Wed (Day 17) | Luisteren | 70%+ |
| Thu (Day 18) | Schrijven | Practice 2 tasks |
| Fri (Day 19) | Spreken | Record & self-assess |
| Sat (Day 20) | Weakest component (repeat) | Improve on last score |
| Sun (Day 21) | Second weakest (repeat) | Improve on last score |

<div class="stat-box">
<div class="stat-number">60%</div>
<div class="stat-label">Minimum passing score for each component — aim for 70%+ to give yourself a safety margin</div>
</div>

If you're consistently scoring above 70% on practice exams, you're on track. If any component is still below 60%, don't panic — you have another week. But do prioritize it.

## Week 4: Polish and Exam Prep (Days 22–30)

**Goal:** Lock in your knowledge. Handle logistics. Walk into the exam calm.

**Days 22–25: Final review rounds**
- One mock exam per day in your two weakest components
- For KNM: review any topics where you keep losing points
- For Schrijven/Spreken: practice your weakest task types one more time
- Stop learning new material by Day 25. From here, it's all consolidation

**Days 26–27: Logistics**
- Book your exam slots at [DUO Inburgeren](https://www.duo.nl) if you haven't already
- Check your exam location — some are in different cities
- Get your ID sorted (passport or residence permit — Dutch driving license alone is not always accepted)
- Plan your route to the exam center

**Days 28–29: Light review**
- Skim your KNM notes one last time
- Do one easy reading passage just to keep the muscle warm
- Practice speaking out loud for 15 minutes — describe your morning routine, talk about your weekend plans
- Go to bed early

**Day 30: Exam day (or final rest day)**
- If your exam is today: eat breakfast, arrive early, trust your preparation
- If your exam is later this week: take the day off from studying. You've put in the work. Rest

<div class="takeaway-box">
<strong>Key takeaway:</strong> The biggest mistake professionals make isn't under-studying — it's over-studying the wrong things. Focus on exam format and question types, not on becoming fluent in Dutch. You're training to pass a specific test, not to write a novel in Dutch.
</div>

## The Cost Factor

Let's talk money, because it's part of your planning.

Each exam component costs between **€40 and €60** at DUO. All six together run about **€290 to €350** total. If you fail a component, you pay again to retake it — which is why getting it right the first time matters.

For a detailed breakdown of every fee, check our [complete cost guide](/blog/inburgering-exam-costs-2026).

Some employers will reimburse inburgering costs, especially if your contract mentions integration support. Ask your HR department — the worst they can say is no.

## What About the Wi2021 vs. Wi2013 Question?

If you're a kennismigrant on the 30% ruling, you fall under the **Wi2013** pathway (the older, simpler system). This means:
- A2-level language exams (not B1)
- Standard KNM exam
- No participation declaration required
- No personal integration plan through the gemeente

This is a genuine advantage. The Wi2021 pathway (for newer obligatory inburgeraars) requires B1-level Dutch, which is significantly harder. Be grateful you're on the easier path and use it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I study for all 6 components at once?
Yes, and you should. The components overlap more than you'd think — KNM knowledge helps with reading comprehension, speaking practice improves your writing, and general Dutch exposure lifts everything. This plan has you rotating through all components deliberately.

### What if I fail one component?
You retake only the failed component. Your passed components stay valid (they don't expire until your inburgering deadline). Most retakes happen within 2 to 4 weeks.

### Is 1 to 2 hours per day really enough?
For A2-level exams with structured practice? Yes. The key word is *structured*. Scrolling through Dutch Instagram for an hour doesn't count. Doing timed practice exams does.

### Should I take a course or self-study?
For most professionals, self-study with good practice materials is more efficient than group courses. Courses move at the pace of the slowest student. Self-study lets you focus on what *you* need. That said, if your Dutch is below A1, a short beginner course can help build the foundation faster.

### What's the best order to take the exams?
Book KNM first — it's the quickest to prepare for and doesn't depend on language level. Then Lezen and Luisteren (multiple choice, less stressful). Save Schrijven and Spreken for last since they benefit most from cumulative practice.

## Your Next Step

Stop reading and start doing. Open a [practice exam](/try) right now — even if you only do 10 questions. The hardest part of this entire process is starting. Once you've done your first practice session, the plan becomes real.

Thirty days from now, you can have this entire process behind you. Or you can still be "planning to start." Your call.
