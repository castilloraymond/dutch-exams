# Best Apps and Tools for Learning Dutch in 2026

The Dutch learning app market is crowded. Duolingo, Babbel, Anki, Memrise, YouTube channels, podcasts, language exchange apps, AI tutors — there's no shortage of options. The problem isn't finding a tool. The problem is figuring out which tools are worth your time and which ones will keep you busy without actually getting you where you need to go.

Here's the uncomfortable truth that no app will tell you: **most language learning apps are great at teaching you Dutch, and terrible at preparing you for the inburgering exam.** Those are different things. You can reach A2 conversational Dutch through apps alone, but passing the DUO exams requires understanding specific test formats that no general language app covers.

This guide gives you an honest breakdown of what each major tool does well, what it does poorly, and where it fits in your preparation journey.

## General Language Apps: Building Your Foundation

These apps are designed to teach you Dutch from scratch. They're best for building vocabulary and basic grammar — the foundation you need before exam-specific prep makes sense.

### Duolingo

**Best for:** Absolute beginners who need a daily habit.

Duolingo's gamified approach works. The streaks, the hearts, the leaderboards — it all keeps you coming back. Their Dutch course covers basic vocabulary and sentence patterns, and the spaced repetition ensures you actually remember what you learn. It's free (with ads) or EUR 8/month for Premium.

**The good:** Low barrier to entry. Five minutes a day feels manageable even when you're exhausted. The listening exercises help train your ear for Dutch pronunciation, and the speaking exercises (on mobile) give you basic production practice.

**The bad:** Duolingo teaches you Duolingo Dutch. The sentences are often weird and decontextualized. You'll learn to say "the duck drinks beer" but not how to write a complaint email to your landlord. The grammar explanations are thin. There's no exam preparation whatsoever — no timed practice, no format training, no KNM content.

**Verdict:** Great as a starter tool for your first 1-3 months. Stop using it once you can handle basic Dutch sentences and switch to exam-focused prep. If you keep grinding Duolingo past the intermediate stage, you're optimizing for streaks, not for passing the exam.

### Babbel

**Best for:** People who want structured grammar lessons, not just vocabulary drills.

Babbel takes a more traditional teaching approach than Duolingo. Lessons follow a curriculum, grammar is explained explicitly, and dialogues are more realistic. Their Dutch course covers A1-B1 content across topics like travel, work, and daily life. It costs about EUR 7-13/month depending on subscription length.

**The good:** Grammar explanations are actually useful. The dialogues feel like real conversations, not random sentences. The review system is solid. Babbel teaches you to speak in full sentences from early on, which helps with Spreken preparation down the line.

**The bad:** Less gamified than Duolingo, which means some people struggle to stick with it. No exam-specific content. The writing exercises are multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank — they won't prepare you for the freeform writing required in the Schrijven exam. Limited free content.

**Verdict:** Better than Duolingo for grammar and conversation skills. Works well as a primary tool for months 1-3 of learning Dutch. Still needs to be supplemented with exam-specific practice.

### Memrise

**Best for:** Vocabulary building through real-world video clips.

Memrise differentiates itself with video clips of native speakers using words and phrases in context. You hear how Dutch actually sounds when real people speak it — not the slow, perfect pronunciation of a textbook recording. The spaced repetition algorithm is effective for long-term retention.

**The good:** The video clips are genuinely helpful for listening comprehension. The app does a good job of teaching common phrases you'll actually hear in the Netherlands. It bridges the gap between classroom Dutch and street Dutch.

**The bad:** Heavy on vocabulary, light on grammar. The course structure is looser than Babbel. Doesn't teach you to produce Dutch — it mostly tests recognition. No exam content.

**Verdict:** Useful as a supplement for listening practice and vocabulary. Pair it with something that teaches grammar. Don't rely on it as your primary tool.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> General language apps are stepping stones, not destinations. They'll get you to basic Dutch, but none of them prepare you for the specific formats the DUO exams use. Plan to transition from general apps to exam-focused practice after 1-3 months.</div>

## Vocabulary and Flashcard Tools

### Anki

**Best for:** Serious vocabulary building with customizable flashcard decks.

Anki is the gold standard for spaced repetition flashcards. It's ugly, the learning curve is steep, and the interface looks like it was designed in 2005. None of that matters, because the algorithm is phenomenal at scheduling reviews exactly when you're about to forget something.

For Dutch, search for shared decks like "Dutch A2 vocabulary," "Inburgering KNM facts," or "Dutch frequency list." Or build your own deck with words you encounter in practice exams.

**The good:** Free on desktop and Android (iOS app is a one-time EUR 25 purchase). The spaced repetition algorithm is unmatched. Community-created Dutch decks are plentiful. You can make KNM-specific decks with facts about Dutch society, which no other app offers.

**The bad:** Not beginner-friendly. The setup process is confusing. Flashcards alone don't teach you grammar or how to use words in context. The quality of shared decks varies wildly — some are excellent, others are full of errors.

**Verdict:** Essential tool if you're serious about vocabulary retention and KNM memorization. Create a custom deck from your practice exam mistakes for maximum efficiency. Not a standalone learning tool.

## Listening Practice: Immersion Tools

Once you have basic Dutch, immersion accelerates your progress faster than any structured lesson. These tools let you immerse yourself in real Dutch content.

### NOS Journaal (Dutch News)

**Best for:** Training your ear with real-world Dutch at natural speed.

NOS is the Dutch public broadcaster. Their news broadcasts, available free online and on the NOS app, give you authentic Dutch at native speaker pace. The Journaal in 2 minuten (2-minute news summary) format is perfect for daily practice.

**The good:** Free. Updated multiple times daily. Covers topics you'll recognize from KNM study (politics, healthcare, economy). The visual context of news broadcasts helps you understand even when you miss words. NOS also publishes written articles, so you can read along after watching.

**The bad:** Full-speed Dutch from day one. If you're below A2, you'll catch about 10% of what's said and feel discouraged. The vocabulary is advanced (news language, not everyday conversation). No subtitles on most broadcasts.

**Verdict:** Start using this once you're at A2 or close to it. Even understanding 30% is useful — your brain fills in gaps over time. Great for building passive listening skills that directly help with the Luisteren exam.

### Dutch Podcasts and YouTube

**Best for:** Extended listening practice at various difficulty levels.

The Dutch YouTube and podcast ecosystem for learners has grown significantly. Channels like Learn Dutch with Bart de Pau, Dutch Pronunciation, and DutchPod101 offer structured content at different levels. For more advanced listeners, regular Dutch podcasts on topics you enjoy (sports, tech, culture) provide natural immersion.

**The good:** Massive variety. You can find content at exactly your level. YouTube auto-generated subtitles in Dutch give you a reading aid. Many channels break down grammar and pronunciation in ways apps don't.

**The bad:** Quality varies enormously. Easy to waste time watching videos that are entertaining but don't actually teach you anything. The temptation to watch with English subtitles defeats the purpose. No structured curriculum — you have to curate your own learning path.

**Verdict:** Pick 2-3 channels that match your level and watch consistently. Resist the urge to turn on English subtitles. For exam prep specifically, look for channels that cover inburgering exam formats.

## Speaking Practice Tools

### Tandem and HelloTalk (Language Exchange)

**Best for:** Free conversation practice with native Dutch speakers.

Language exchange apps connect you with native Dutch speakers who want to learn your language. You speak Dutch for 15 minutes, then switch to English (or whatever language your partner wants to practice) for 15 minutes. It's free and you get real human conversation practice.

**The good:** Free. You practice with real people, not a robot. Native speakers can correct your mistakes in real time. You build confidence talking to strangers in Dutch — useful for the Spreken exam and life in general.

**The bad:** Finding a reliable partner takes time. Many conversations fizzle after one or two sessions. The quality of error correction varies wildly — most people are not language teachers. Sessions can drift into English easily. You need to be at least basic conversational for this to work.

**Verdict:** Excellent supplement once you're at A2 or above. Don't rely on it as your primary speaking practice — it's too unpredictable. But even one consistent language partner can transform your speaking confidence.

### AI Conversation Tools

**Best for:** On-demand speaking practice without scheduling a human.

AI-powered conversation tools have gotten remarkably good at simulating Dutch conversations. ChatGPT can role-play scenarios (calling a doctor, discussing a problem with your landlord) and correct your Dutch in real time. Dedicated apps offer more structured conversation practice.

**The good:** Available 24/7. No scheduling. No embarrassment when you make mistakes. Can be tailored to specific exam scenarios. Patient and tireless.

**The bad:** Still not quite natural. Misses nuances a human would catch. Can't fully replicate the pressure of the real Spreken exam's recording format. Over-reliance on AI means you might freeze when talking to actual humans.

**Verdict:** Great for daily practice, especially for Spreken exam scenarios. Use it alongside human conversation practice, not instead of it.

## Social Media: The Underrated Tool

One of the most effective (and free) ways to immerse yourself in Dutch doesn't require any app installation. Just switch your social media language settings to Dutch.

Change your Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, and Reddit to Dutch. Follow Dutch news accounts, Dutch meme pages, Dutch creators in your areas of interest. Your daily doom-scrolling suddenly becomes language practice.

Follow your local gemeente on social media. Join Dutch expat groups that post in Dutch. Read comments sections. The language is informal, current, and full of the kind of everyday Dutch that shows up on A2 exams.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Change your phone's system language to Dutch. Every notification, every menu, every app suddenly becomes a micro-lesson. Annoying for the first three days, then you stop noticing — and start understanding.</div>

## Exam-Specific Tools: What Actually Prepares You for DUO

Here's where the gap in the market becomes obvious. All the tools above teach you Dutch. None of them teach you how to pass the inburgering exam. The exam has specific formats, specific question types, specific time limits, and a specific body of KNM knowledge. Generic language practice won't cover those.

### PassInBurgering.com (Exam Practice Platform)

**Best for:** Practicing the actual exam formats under realistic conditions.

This is our platform, so take this with appropriate skepticism — but here's why we built it: because nothing else covers this gap. [PassInBurgering](/learn) offers practice exams for all testable components (Lezen, Luisteren, KNM, Schrijven, Spreken) in the exact formats DUO uses. Timed. Multiple choice for the MC components. Free-text for writing. Recording-based for speaking.

**What it covers:**
- **Lezen** practice exams with passages matching A2 difficulty and real exam question formats
- **Luisteren** exercises with Dutch audio at exam-appropriate speed
- **KNM** practice covering all 8 topic areas in the post-July 2025 format
- **Schrijven** tasks mirroring the email, form, and message formats DUO uses
- **Spreken** prompts following the actual exam structure

**Why it matters:** You can be at A2 Dutch level and still fail the exam if you've never practiced the format. The exam isn't testing whether you're good at Dutch — it's testing whether you can perform specific tasks in Dutch under specific conditions. Practicing those conditions is the single highest-ROI activity in your preparation.

Try a [free practice exam](/try) to see how it works.

### DUO Practice Exams

DUO themselves offer some practice materials on [inburgeren.nl](https://inburgeren.nl). These are the most authentic source since they come from the exam provider. Limited in quantity, but worth doing at least once to see the exact interface and format you'll encounter on exam day.

## Building Your Tool Stack: What to Use When

Here's the thing — no single tool does everything. The trick is combining the right tools at the right time. Here's a practical stack for different stages of preparation:

### Stage 1: Building Basics (0 to A1)
If you're starting from zero Dutch:
- **Primary:** Duolingo or Babbel (20-30 min/day)
- **Supplement:** Anki with a Dutch frequency list (10 min/day)
- **Duration:** 1-3 months

### Stage 2: Reaching A2 (A1 to A2)
Once you have basic Dutch:
- **Primary:** Babbel for grammar + NOS Journaal for listening (30 min/day)
- **Supplement:** Anki for vocabulary gaps, Tandem for weekly conversation (15 min/day)
- **Social media:** Switch to Dutch
- **Duration:** 1-2 months

### Stage 3: Exam Prep (A2 level, ready for format training)
When your Dutch is at or near A2:
- **Primary:** [PassInBurgering practice exams](/learn) (30-60 min/day)
- **Supplement:** Anki for KNM facts, speaking practice daily (15-20 min/day)
- **Drop:** Duolingo, Babbel (they've served their purpose)
- **Duration:** 2-6 weeks

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Watch out:</strong> The biggest trap is staying in Stage 1 forever. Apps like Duolingo are designed to keep you engaged indefinitely. At some point, you need to put down the language app and pick up actual exam materials. If you've been using Duolingo for 6+ months and haven't started exam prep, it's time to switch.</div>

## What About Expensive Course Platforms?

Premium online platforms like Rosetta Stone (EUR 12-20/month) and Pimsleur (EUR 15-20/month) offer Dutch courses. Are they worth it?

For most inburgering candidates: no. These platforms are designed for comprehensive language learning, not exam preparation. They're well-made, but they solve a different problem than the one you have. You don't need to become fluent in Dutch. You need to pass six specific exams at A2 level. That requires targeted practice, not broad language education.

The exception: if you're a complete beginner and learn best through a single structured platform rather than combining multiple free tools, a paid platform can provide that structure. Just don't expect it to prepare you for the exam formats.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I pass the inburgering exam using only free tools?

**Yes.** Duolingo (free tier) for basics, Anki (free on desktop/Android) for vocabulary, NOS for listening, social media in Dutch for immersion, and [free practice exams](/try) for format training. The only thing you'll pay for is the DUO exam fees themselves. Read our [cost breakdown](/blog/inburgering-exam-costs-2026) for the full picture.

### How many apps should I use at once?

**Two to three maximum.** One primary learning tool, one vocabulary tool, and one for listening immersion. Using more than three creates decision fatigue and fragments your study time. When you enter exam prep mode, consolidate to one exam practice platform and one review tool.

### Duolingo says I'm 40% fluent in Dutch. Am I ready for the exam?

Duolingo's fluency percentage is meaningless for exam readiness. It measures how much of their course you've completed, not your actual language level. The only way to know if you're ready is to take a [practice exam](/try) in the actual DUO format. You might be more ready than Duolingo suggests, or less ready — the only way to find out is to test yourself.

### Should I use a Dutch-English dictionary while studying?

During the learning phase, yes — it speeds up comprehension. During exam practice, absolutely not. The real exam doesn't allow dictionaries. Practice without one so you develop the skill of inferring meaning from context. This is a core A2 reading skill that the Lezen exam specifically tests.

### How long before the exam should I stop using language apps and focus purely on exam prep?

**At least 3-4 weeks before your exam date,** your study time should be 80%+ exam practice, 20% maintenance. If you're still splitting time 50/50 between Duolingo and exam prep in the final weeks, you're leaving points on the table. The format familiarity you gain from focused exam practice is worth more than incremental vocabulary gains at that stage.

## The Bottom Line

The best tool is the one you actually use consistently. Duolingo with a 90-day streak beats Babbel abandoned after a week. An Anki deck you review every morning beats a premium course you open twice.

But at some point — and that point is sooner than most people think — you have to transition from learning Dutch to preparing for the exam. General language apps won't teach you the KNM content. They won't simulate timed exam conditions. They won't show you the Schrijven email format or the Spreken recording structure.

Build your foundation with whatever app clicks for you. Then switch to targeted exam prep. That's the formula.
