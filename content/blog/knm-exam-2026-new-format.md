# KNM Exam 2025 Changes: What You Need to Know About the New Format

The KNM exam was completely redesigned in July 2025. The old video-based scenario format is gone — replaced by **40 factual multiple-choice questions** covering Dutch society, history, and daily life. If you're preparing with materials from before July 2025, you're studying for an exam that no longer exists.

This matters because the KNM is one of six components you need to pass for your inburgeringsdiploma. No diploma means no permanent residence, no Dutch citizenship. And the KNM is the section that catches the most professionals off guard — living in the Netherlands doesn't mean you know what DigiD is, how the healthcare referral system works, or what Keti Koti commemorates.

## What Actually Changed in July 2025?

The short answer: everything except the name. KNM stands for Kennis van de Nederlandse Maatschappij — Knowledge of Dutch Society — and the exam now lives up to that name in a much more literal way.

Before July 2025, the KNM exam showed you video clips of everyday situations in the Netherlands — a doctor's appointment, a conversation with a landlord, a parent-teacher meeting. You'd watch the scenario, then answer questions about what the person should do. It tested situational judgment more than factual knowledge.

That format is dead. The new KNM is a straightforward factual knowledge test. **40 multiple-choice questions, 45 minutes, pass mark of 28/40 (70%).** No videos. No scenarios. Just: do you know how Dutch society works?

The cost is still **€50**, and you still register through the [Mijn Inburgering portal](https://inburgeren.nl) using DigiD. But what you need to know — and how you need to study — is fundamentally different.

## What Does the New KNM Exam Test?

The new format covers **8 themes** organized across 4 life areas. Here's what you're responsible for:

### Work & Income (Werk)

How employment contracts work in the Netherlands, your rights as an employee, the role of the UWV, how to find work, and how taxes are structured. If you're on a 30% ruling, you probably know more about Dutch employment law than you think — but you'll still need to know specifics about minimum wage, dismissal rules, and the social security system.

### Health & Healthcare (Gezondheid)

The Dutch healthcare system trips up a lot of professionals. You need to know the GP referral model (huisarts → specialist), how health insurance works, the role of the **POH (praktijkondersteuner huisarts)** — a relatively new addition to the exam — and mental health services available. The new exam also tests you on when to call 112 vs. your huisarts vs. the huisartsenpost.

### Values & Norms (Normen en Waarden)

This section expanded significantly. It now includes questions on the **Holocaust**, **women's rights**, and Dutch equality principles. You'll be tested on constitutional rights, the role of the Ombudsman, anti-discrimination laws, and LGBTQ+ rights in the Netherlands. The exam expects you to know specific facts, not just general principles.

### Housing (Wonen)

Tenant rights, how to register at your municipality, the role of housing associations, and rules around renting vs. buying. If you've rented an apartment in the Netherlands, you'll recognize some of this — but the exam asks about specific procedures and legal protections you might not have encountered.

### Geography, History & Institutions

This is where the biggest surprises land. The new KNM tests:

- **Dutch geography** — provinces, major cities, waterways
- **History** — including the **Holocaust** and its significance in Dutch society, colonial history, and the path to modern democracy
- **Cultural celebrations** — **Keti Koti** (July 1, commemorating the abolition of slavery) and **Eid al-Fitr** are now specifically tested
- **Education system** — how Dutch schools work, the CITO test, higher education structure
- **Political system** — how the Tweede Kamer works, the role of the King, coalition governments

### Digital Skills

Brand new to the exam. You need to understand **DigiD** (what it is, how to use it, what services require it) and **digital safety** basics (phishing, online fraud, protecting personal data). For tech professionals, this should be straightforward — but don't skip it. The questions test Dutch-specific digital government services, not general tech literacy.

## Old Format vs. New Format — Side by Side

| | Old KNM (Before July 2025) | New KNM (July 2025+) |
|---|---|---|
| **Format** | Video scenarios + questions | Factual multiple-choice only |
| **Questions** | Varied (scenario-dependent) | **40 MC questions** |
| **Duration** | ~30 minutes | **45 minutes** |
| **Pass threshold** | Situational scoring | **28/40 (70%)** |
| **Content** | Situational judgment | Factual knowledge |
| **Topics** | Daily life scenarios | **8 themes across 4 life areas** |
| **New topics** | N/A | DigiD, digital safety, Holocaust, Keti Koti, Eid al-Fitr, POH, mental health, women's rights |
| **Cost** | €50 | **€50** (unchanged) |

## Why This Matters If You're Using Old Study Materials

Here's the thing. A lot of the KNM prep materials floating around — YouTube videos, PDFs, practice question banks from language schools — were built for the video scenario format. They'll teach you how to read situational cues and pick the "most appropriate response." That skill is irrelevant now.

The new exam tests whether you know specific facts. What is DigiD? Name two rights in the Dutch constitution. What does Keti Koti commemorate? When do you call the huisartsenpost vs. the emergency number? These aren't judgment calls — they're factual recall questions with one correct answer.

If your study material doesn't mention the Holocaust, Keti Koti, POH, or digital safety, it was made for the old format. Throw it out. Seriously.

This is one of the most common mistakes we see: professionals who've been living in the Netherlands for years assume they can wing the KNM because they "know Dutch society." Then they encounter questions about the Ombudsman's role or the specifics of how housing associations operate, and they're stuck.

## How to Prepare for the New KNM Format

The good news: the new format is actually more straightforward to prepare for. Factual knowledge is studiable. You can't really study "situational judgment," but you absolutely can memorize that there are 12 provinces and that Keti Koti is on July 1.

Here's what works:

### Study by Theme, Not by Random Questions

Go through each of the 8 themes systematically. Don't just do random practice questions and hope for coverage. Work through Werk, then Gezondheid, then Normen en Waarden — in order. You'll build a structured knowledge base instead of scattered fragments.

### Focus on the New Topics First

The topics added in July 2025 — DigiD, digital safety, Holocaust, women's rights, Keti Koti, Eid al-Fitr, mental health, POH — are the ones most likely to trip you up. You won't find these in older study materials, and they're the topics where even long-term residents have gaps. Start here.

### 20 Minutes a Day Is Enough

You don't need to block off three-hour study sessions. Most professionals who pass the KNM prepared with **20-minute daily sessions over 2–3 weeks**. That's a practice set during your lunch break or after the kids are in bed. Consistency beats intensity for factual memorization.

### Practice With Updated Material

This should be obvious, but: make sure whatever practice exams you're using reflect the post-July 2025 format. The [KNM practice section on PassInBurgering](/learn/knm) covers all 8 themes with questions that match the new format — **96 practice questions** across all topics, including the new ones.

### Don't Underestimate This Exam

The KNM is the component where overconfident professionals are most likely to fail. Reading and listening test your Dutch language ability. KNM tests specific factual knowledge about a society you might live in but haven't systematically studied. The **70% pass threshold** (28 out of 40) means you can afford to get 12 wrong — but that margin disappears fast if you haven't covered all 8 themes.

## Frequently Asked Questions About the KNM Exam 2025 Changes

### When did the KNM exam change?

The new KNM format took effect in **July 2025**. Anyone taking the KNM exam after that date gets the new format — 40 factual multiple-choice questions instead of the old video scenario format.

### What score do I need to pass the new KNM?

You need **28 out of 40 correct answers** to pass, which is a **70% threshold**. The exam lasts 45 minutes, giving you roughly one minute per question.

### Do I need to speak Dutch for the KNM?

The KNM tests your knowledge of Dutch society, not your language skills. The questions are in Dutch at around A2 level, so you need enough Dutch to read and understand the questions and answer options. But the exam itself is about factual knowledge — politics, healthcare, history, values — not language fluency.

### How much does the KNM exam cost?

The KNM exam costs **€50**. This hasn't changed with the new format. You register and pay through the [Mijn Inburgering portal](https://inburgeren.nl) using your DigiD.

### Can I still use old KNM study materials?

Some general knowledge about Dutch society will still apply. But the format, question types, and several topics are completely new. Materials created before July 2025 won't cover DigiD, digital safety, the Holocaust, Keti Koti, Eid al-Fitr, POH, or mental health — all of which are now on the exam. Your safest bet is to use materials specifically designed for the new format.

## What's Next

The KNM exam change is part of a broader trend — the entire inburgering exam system has been updated in 2025. The [speaking exam also changed in March 2025](/blog/inburgering-exam-guide-professionals-2026), removing all multiple-choice questions in favor of spoken answers. If you're a [kennismigrant on the 30% ruling](/blog/inburgering-kennismigranten-30-percent-ruling), getting clear on which exams you need and what format to expect is the first step.

The practice exams on PassInBurgering are free during early access and already updated for the new KNM format. If you want to see what the new questions look like, [try a KNM practice set](/learn/knm) — it takes about 20 minutes, and you'll know right away where your gaps are.
