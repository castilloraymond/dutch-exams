# KNM Exam 2025 Changes: What You Need to Know About the New Format

If you're studying for the KNM exam right now, here's something that could save you weeks of wasted effort: **the entire exam was overhauled in July 2025**. If your study materials are from before that date, you're preparing for a test that no longer exists.

The KNM -- Kennis van de Nederlandse Maatschappij (Knowledge of Dutch Society) -- used to be one of the quirkier parts of the inburgering exam. It relied on video scenarios and situational judgment. That's all gone now. The new format is a straightforward factual knowledge test, and that actually works in your favor if you know what to expect.

Here's the breakdown.

## What Actually Changed

The old KNM exam showed you video clips of everyday situations in the Netherlands -- visiting a doctor, dealing with a landlord, interacting with colleagues. You'd watch the scenario and then answer questions about what the "best" response would be. It was part cultural awareness, part guessing game.

**The new format scrapped all of that.** As of July 2025, the KNM exam is **40 factual multiple-choice questions** about how Dutch society works. No more videos. No more "what would you do?" judgment calls. It's now a pure knowledge test: you either know the answer or you don't.

The exam is still computer-based at DUO test centers, and it's still part of the inburgering exam package alongside Lezen, Luisteren, Schrijven, Spreken, and the ONA. The pass mark sits at approximately **60% correct** -- so you need around **24 out of 40** to pass.

## Old Format vs. New Format

Here's a side-by-side so you can see exactly what shifted:

| | **Old Format (Pre-July 2025)** | **New Format (July 2025+)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Question type** | Situational judgment based on video clips | Factual multiple-choice |
| **Number of questions** | Varied by scenario | **40 questions** |
| **Content style** | "What's the best reaction in this situation?" | "How does this system work in the Netherlands?" |
| **Media** | Video scenarios with actors | Text-only questions |
| **Skill tested** | Cultural intuition and judgment | Factual knowledge recall |
| **Topics** | Loosely themed around daily life | **8 defined topic areas** |
| **Pass mark** | ~60% | ~**60% (approx. 24/40)** |
| **Test location** | DUO test center, computer-based | DUO test center, computer-based |

The short answer is: the new version is more predictable. You can study concrete facts instead of trying to guess what DUO considers the "right" cultural response.

## The 8 Topics You'll Be Tested On

The new KNM exam covers **8 main topic areas**. Every question maps to one of these:

1. **Geografie** -- Dutch geography, provinces, major cities, waterways
2. **Geschiedenis** -- Key moments in Dutch history you're expected to know
3. **Gezondheid** -- How healthcare works, especially the referral chain (huisarts to specialist), health insurance
4. **Normen en Waarden** -- Social norms, values, and cultural expectations in the Netherlands
5. **Onderwijs** -- The Dutch education system, school types, how it's structured
6. **Politiek** -- Political system, how government works, elections, monarchy
7. **Werk** -- Work culture, employment rights, contracts, workplace norms
8. **Wonen** -- Tenant rights, rental contracts, housing associations, utilities

If you're a kennismigrant on the 30% ruling, you'll probably find that you already know chunks of this from daily life. Things like how your huisarts referral system works, or what DigiD is for -- that's just stuff you've dealt with. The exam formalizes it.

## How to Prepare for the New Format

Here's the thing: the shift from situational judgment to factual recall changes how you should study. The old exam rewarded cultural instinct. The new one rewards knowing specific facts.

**What works now:**

- **Flashcard-style review.** The questions are factual, so drilling key facts across all 8 topics is the most time-efficient approach. Know the names, the systems, the processes.
- **Topic-by-topic coverage.** Don't skip areas. The questions span all 8 topics, and you can't predict which ones will show up more heavily on your specific exam.
- **Practice with updated questions.** This is critical. Old KNM practice materials test situational judgment -- that's useless now. Make sure whatever you're using reflects the post-July 2025 format.

**What doesn't work anymore:**

- Watching video scenarios and practicing "best response" reasoning
- Studying cultural sensitivity guides aimed at the old format
- Using any prep materials published before mid-2025

We've built our entire [KNM practice module](/learn/knm) around the updated 8-topic structure, so every question matches what you'll see at DUO.

## Why This Change Is Good News for Professionals

Spoiler alert: the new format is better for you if you're a busy professional. Here's why.

The old video-based exam was unpredictable. Two people could study the same material and come away with different results because the "right" answer often felt subjective. You'd second-guess yourself: "Is this what a Dutch person would do, or what DUO thinks a Dutch person would do?"

The new format removes that ambiguity. **A fact is a fact.** The King's name is Willem-Alexander. The huisarts is your first point of contact. Tenants have specific rights under Dutch rental law. You either know it or you don't, and you can study it efficiently.

For someone juggling a demanding job, that predictability is huge. You can study in focused 20-minute sessions, track what you know and what you don't, and walk into the exam confident that your preparation matches the test.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When did the new KNM format take effect?

**July 2025.** Any exam you sit from that date onward uses the new 40-question factual format. If you booked your exam before July 2025 but took it after, you got the new version.

### How many questions are on the new KNM exam?

**40 multiple-choice questions.** All text-based, no video components. You need approximately 60% correct (around 24 out of 40) to pass.

### Can I still use old KNM study materials?

You can, but it's not a great idea. The old materials focus on video scenarios and situational judgment -- skills that aren't tested anymore. You'll waste time on content that won't appear on your exam. Stick to materials that cover the 8 topic areas with factual questions.

### What topics does the new KNM exam cover?

Eight main areas: geography, history, healthcare, social norms and values, education, politics, work, and housing. Questions test factual knowledge about how these systems work in the Netherlands.

### Is the KNM exam available in English?

No. The KNM exam is in Dutch. However, the language level required isn't as high as the Lezen or Luisteren exams -- the questions are written in relatively straightforward Dutch. If you can read at an A2 level, you'll be able to understand the questions. The challenge is knowing the content, not deciphering the language.
