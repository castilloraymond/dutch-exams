# Dutch Healthcare for Expats: How the System Works (and What KNM Tests You On)

The Dutch healthcare system confuses almost every expat who encounters it for the first time. You can't just walk into a hospital. Your GP decides whether you're sick enough to see a specialist. Dental care isn't covered the way you'd expect. And you're paying a monthly premium *plus* a yearly deductible *plus* whatever your insurance doesn't cover.

Here's the thing, though: once you understand the logic behind it, the system actually works well. And understanding it serves you twice — it makes your life in the Netherlands easier, *and* it prepares you for one of the biggest topic areas on the KNM exam.

The KNM (Kennis van de Nederlandse Maatschappij) exam dedicates a significant chunk of its 40 questions to healthcare. If you don't understand how the huisarts system works, what the eigen risico is, or when to call 112 versus the huisartsenpost, you're giving away easy points.

This guide covers both angles: how the system actually works in practice, and what the KNM exam expects you to know about it.

## Mandatory Health Insurance: Zorgverzekering

If you live or work in the Netherlands, you are **legally required** to have health insurance (zorgverzekering). No exceptions. No "I'm young and healthy" exemptions. This is the single most important thing to understand about Dutch healthcare.

The system has two layers:

**Basisverzekering (basic insurance)** — This is the mandatory package that every insurer must offer. It covers GP visits, hospital care, prescription medication, mental health treatment, maternity care, and ambulance transport. The coverage is standardized by the government. It doesn't matter which insurance company you choose — the basic package covers the same things everywhere.

**Aanvullende verzekering (supplementary insurance)** — This is optional, and it covers things the basic package doesn't: dental care for adults, physiotherapy beyond a certain number of sessions, glasses, alternative medicine. Each insurer offers different supplementary packages at different prices.

**Key facts the KNM tests you on:**

- Health insurance is **mandatory** for everyone living in the Netherlands
- You must sign up within **4 months** of starting work or moving to the Netherlands
- Children under 18 are insured for free under a parent's policy
- Low-income residents can receive **zorgtoeslag** (healthcare allowance) from the Belastingdienst
- You can switch insurers once per year, during the open enrollment period (typically November-December for the following year)

## The Huisarts: Your Healthcare Gatekeeper

The huisarts (general practitioner / family doctor) is the center of the Dutch healthcare system. This is the part that trips up most expats, especially those from countries where you can go directly to a specialist.

**How it works:** You register with a local huisarts practice (huisartsenpraktijk). When you're sick, injured, or have a health concern, your huisarts is your **first point of contact** for everything. Flu symptoms? Huisarts. Persistent back pain? Huisarts. Worried about a mole? Huisarts.

The huisarts examines you, makes an initial diagnosis, and decides the next step. That might be:
- Treatment and a prescription
- A referral (verwijzing) to a specialist at a hospital
- Lab tests or imaging
- A follow-up appointment
- Reassurance that you're fine (this happens more often than you'd like)

**You cannot see a specialist without a referral from your huisarts.** This is the gatekeeping system, and it's both the most praised and most criticized aspect of Dutch healthcare. The idea is that GPs handle 90% of health issues, which keeps specialist care efficient and available for those who truly need it.

**Registering with a huisarts:**

- Find a practice near your home (they typically only accept patients within their area)
- Call or visit to register — some practices have waiting lists, especially in busy cities
- Registration is free and covered by your basic insurance
- You stay registered with the same huisarts unless you move

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Watch out:</strong> Register with a huisarts as soon as you arrive in the Netherlands, not when you first get sick. Some practices in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Utrecht have months-long waiting lists. Don't wait until you need care to discover this.</div>

**What the KNM tests:**

- The huisarts is the first point of contact for all non-emergency medical issues
- You need a **verwijzing** (referral) to see a specialist
- The **POH** (praktijkondersteuner huisarts) is a specialized nurse working at the GP practice who handles chronic conditions like diabetes, COPD, and mental health concerns
- The **huisartsenpost** is the after-hours GP service for urgent (but non-emergency) care on evenings, nights, and weekends

## How Referrals and Hospital Visits Work

So your huisarts decides you need to see a specialist. What happens next?

1. **Your huisarts writes a referral** (verwijzing) — this is usually done digitally and sent directly to the hospital or specialist
2. **You choose the hospital** — you have the right to choose which hospital or specialist you visit, not just the nearest one. Some people choose based on waiting times, specialization, or their insurer's preferred network.
3. **The hospital contacts you** to schedule an appointment, or you call them directly with your referral
4. **You visit the specialist** — they examine you, run any necessary tests, and determine a treatment plan
5. **The specialist reports back** to your huisarts with findings and recommendations

**Cost of specialist care:**

Specialist visits and hospital treatments are covered by your basisverzekering, but they count toward your **eigen risico** (deductible). More on that in the next section.

**Emergency care is different.** If it's a genuine emergency — chest pain, severe injury, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness — you go directly to the **spoedeisende hulp** (emergency room) or call **112**. No referral needed. The emergency room is for emergencies, not for that cough you've had for a week.

## Eigen Risico: The Deductible That Surprises Everyone

The eigen risico is the annual deductible on your health insurance. In 2026, the mandatory eigen risico is **€385 per year**. This means you pay the first €385 of healthcare costs (beyond GP visits) out of your own pocket before your insurance kicks in.

**What counts toward eigen risico:**
- Specialist consultations
- Hospital treatments and stays
- Prescription medication
- Mental health care (after the initial sessions covered by basic)
- Ambulance transport

**What does NOT count toward eigen risico:**
- **GP visits** — these are always free (covered directly by basic insurance)
- **Maternity care** — fully covered, no deductible
- **Children's healthcare** (under 18) — no deductible applies

The eigen risico resets every January 1st. If you spent €200 toward your deductible last year, it doesn't carry over. You start fresh at €0 each year.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> GP visits are always free. That's why the huisarts-first system exists — it keeps your day-to-day healthcare costs at zero while reserving specialist care (and the deductible) for when you actually need it.</div>

**KNM exam angle:** Questions about eigen risico are common. Know the amount (€385 in 2026), what it applies to, and that GP visits are exempt. Also know that you can choose a *higher* voluntary deductible (up to €885) in exchange for a lower monthly premium — a gamble that pays off if you rarely need specialist care.

## Dental, Physio, and Other Care

A few areas of Dutch healthcare that catch expats off guard:

**Dental care (tandarts):**

Adult dental care is **not covered** by the basic insurance package. Routine check-ups, fillings, crowns — you pay for these yourself unless you have supplementary insurance that includes dental. Children's dental care (up to age 18) is covered by basic insurance.

A basic dental check-up costs around €30-€50. A filling might run €80-€150. If dental care matters to you, get a supplementary package that covers it.

**Physiotherapy (fysiotherapie):**

Basic insurance covers physiotherapy only in specific cases — typically conditions on a government-defined list (like COPD, Parkinson's, or post-surgery rehabilitation), and only after an initial number of sessions that you pay yourself. For general physiotherapy (back pain, sports injuries), you need supplementary insurance or pay out of pocket (€35-€55 per session).

**Mental health care (GGZ):**

Basic insurance covers mental health care, but the system has layers:
- Your **huisarts** or **POH-GGZ** (the practice nurse specializing in mental health) handles initial assessment and mild concerns
- **Basis-GGZ** (basic mental healthcare) covers short-term treatment for mild to moderate conditions
- **Gespecialiseerde GGZ** (specialized mental healthcare) handles complex or long-term conditions

Waiting lists for mental health care can be long — sometimes months. This is a known issue in the Dutch system.

## Emergency Numbers and After-Hours Care

This is a common KNM exam topic, and it's practical knowledge you need anyway:

| Situation | What to Do | Number |
|---|---|---|
| **Life-threatening emergency** | Call immediately | **112** |
| **Urgent but not life-threatening** (evenings/weekends) | Call the huisartsenpost | **0900-1515** (or your local number) |
| **Non-urgent health question** | Call your huisarts during office hours | Your practice's number |
| **Poisoning** | Call the National Poison Information Center | **030-274 8888** |

**112** is the European emergency number. It connects you to ambulance, fire, and police dispatch. Use it when someone's life is in danger, not for a twisted ankle on a Sunday.

The **huisartsenpost** is the after-hours GP clinic. If your child has a high fever at 10 PM on a Saturday and you're worried, this is who you call. They'll assess by phone and invite you to come in if needed. You don't need an appointment — you call, they triage, and they see you if it's urgent enough.

## Maternity Care: A Dutch Specialty

The Netherlands has a unique maternity care system that the KNM exam loves to test:

- **Verloskundige** (midwife) is the primary care provider for pregnancy, not an OB-GYN. Low-risk pregnancies are managed entirely by midwives.
- **Home births** are more common in the Netherlands than in most countries, though hospital births have been increasing. You choose where to give birth.
- **Kraamzorg** (maternity home care) is a uniquely Dutch service. After birth, a kraamverzorgster comes to your home for about a week to help with the baby, monitor the mother's recovery, and teach new parents the basics. This is covered by basic insurance.

## Sample KNM-Style Questions

Test yourself with these practice questions. They mirror the format and difficulty of actual KNM exam questions about healthcare.

A. Go to the hospital emergency room
B. Make an appointment with her huisarts
C. Call 112
D. Visit a physiotherapist

**Answer:** B. The huisarts is always the first point of contact for non-emergency health issues.

**Question 2:** What is the eigen risico?

A. The monthly premium you pay for health insurance
B. The annual amount you pay before insurance covers specialist care
C. The fee you pay for each GP visit
D. The cost of supplementary insurance

**Answer:** B. The eigen risico is your annual deductible for specialist care and other services (not GP visits).

**Question 3:** It's Saturday night at 11 PM. Your 3-year-old has a fever of 40°C and is crying constantly. What do you do?

A. Wait until Monday and call your huisarts
B. Call the huisartsenpost
C. Call 112
D. Go to the pharmacy

**Answer:** B. A high fever in a young child on a weekend evening is urgent but not immediately life-threatening — call the huisartsenpost. They'll assess by phone and tell you to come in if needed.

## How to Study Healthcare for the KNM

Healthcare is one of the more straightforward KNM topics because you can connect it to your actual experience living in the Netherlands. Here's how to approach it:

**If you've already been to the huisarts:** Good — you already understand the system intuitively. Focus on the details you might not know: the exact eigen risico amount, the POH's role, the difference between basis-GGZ and specialized GGZ.

**If you haven't used the Dutch healthcare system yet:** Read through this guide twice, then take practice exams to see which details stick and which don't. The huisarts gatekeeping model is the most-tested concept — make sure you understand it cold.

**Common KNM traps in healthcare questions:**
- Confusing the huisartsenpost (after-hours GP) with the spoedeisende hulp (emergency room)
- Not knowing that GP visits are free / don't count toward eigen risico
- Forgetting that dental care for adults requires supplementary insurance
- Mixing up when to call 112 (life-threatening) versus the huisartsenpost (urgent but not life-threatening)

The healthcare section of the KNM is one of the easier sections to prepare for because the concepts are practical and logical. Once you understand the flow — huisarts first, referral if needed, eigen risico for specialist care — the questions almost answer themselves.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I really need health insurance if I'm young and healthy?

Yes. It's a legal requirement. If you don't have health insurance within 4 months of becoming eligible, the CAK (Central Administration Office) will contact you, sign you up for a policy, and bill you — often at a higher premium than you'd have paid by choosing your own insurer.

### Can I keep my home country's insurance instead?

In most cases, no. If you work in the Netherlands or have a Dutch residence permit, you're required to take Dutch health insurance. There are limited exceptions for posted workers and cross-border commuters. Check with the SVB (Sociale Verzekeringsbank) if you think you qualify for an exception.

### What if I can't afford the monthly premium?

Apply for **zorgtoeslag** (healthcare allowance) through the Belastingdienst. Depending on your income, you can receive up to ~€120/month to offset your premium costs. Apply at toeslagen.nl using your DigiD.

### How do I find a huisarts who speaks English?

Many huisarts practices in major cities have English-speaking doctors. Ask expat groups on Facebook or check platforms like Zorgkaart Nederland (zorgkaartnederland.nl) where you can filter by language. But fair warning: the KNM exam assumes you're interacting with the healthcare system in Dutch.

### Is my partner covered under my insurance?

No. Each adult needs their own policy. Unlike some countries where family plans cover spouses, the Netherlands requires individual insurance for each adult. Children under 18 are covered for free under a parent's policy.
