# How the Lezen (Reading) Exam Works: Format, Scoring & What to Expect

The Lezen (reading) exam is where most people start their inburgering journey — and for good reason. Out of the four language components, reading is typically the most approachable. You don't have to speak, write, or understand rapid-fire Dutch audio. You just need to read short texts and answer multiple-choice questions.

That said, "approachable" doesn't mean "easy to walk into cold." The exam has a specific format, specific text types, and specific traps that catch unprepared candidates. Knowing what to expect before you sit down at that computer screen makes a real difference.

This guide covers the complete Lezen exam — what it looks like, how it's scored, what kinds of texts appear, and the strategies that actually work.

## Exam Format at a Glance

The Lezen exam is a computer-based test taken at a DUO exam center. Here's the structure:

| Detail | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Level** | A2 (Wi2013) |
| **Format** | Multiple choice |
| **Number of questions** | Approximately 25 |
| **Time limit** | 65 minutes |
| **Pass mark** | Approximately 60% correct |
| **Cost** | €48 per attempt |
| **Administered by** | DUO at designated exam centers |

You'll sit at a computer in an exam room with other candidates (who may be taking different inburgering components). The interface shows a text passage on screen with questions underneath. Each question has 3-4 answer options. You click your answer, move to the next question, and can go back to review previous answers before submitting.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">65 min</div><div class="stat-label">Total time for approximately 25 questions — that's over 2.5 minutes per question</div></div>

**Important:** the 65-minute time limit is generous for 25 questions. Most prepared candidates finish with 15-20 minutes to spare. If you find yourself rushing, it usually means you're overthinking rather than running out of time.

## What Kinds of Texts Appear on the Exam?

The Lezen exam tests your ability to understand the kind of Dutch you'd encounter in daily life. These aren't literary novels or academic papers. They're practical, everyday texts — the kind you'd find in your mailbox, on a notice board, or in your email inbox.

Here are the main text types you'll see:

### Short Advertisements

Job postings, apartment listings, event announcements, classified ads. These are usually 3-5 sentences long with specific details — dates, prices, locations, requirements. Questions typically ask you to find a specific piece of information.

*Example scenario:* An ad for a part-time job at a supermarket. The question asks what hours the position requires, or what experience is needed.

### Emails and Letters

Simple correspondence — a message from your child's school about a parent evening, an email from your landlord about building maintenance, a letter from your municipality about garbage collection schedules. These are slightly longer (5-10 sentences) and test whether you can understand the main message and specific details.

*Example scenario:* An email from a neighbor about a shared hallway. The question asks what the neighbor is requesting.

### Notices and Signs

Public notices, warning signs, instructions posted in a building or on a website. These tend to be very short — sometimes just a few lines. The challenge is understanding the purpose and any specific instructions.

*Example scenario:* A notice on an apartment building door about elevator maintenance. The question asks when the elevator will be unavailable.

### Short Information Texts

Brief articles or informational texts about everyday topics — how to register at a GP, what to do if you lose your OV-chipkaart, library opening hours. These are the longest texts on the exam, typically 8-15 sentences, and questions may ask about the main idea or specific details.

*Example scenario:* A short text about recycling rules in your municipality. The question asks which bin goes out on which day.

### Forms and Tables

Partially filled forms, schedules, or simple tables. You need to read and interpret structured information — a bus schedule, a class timetable, a comparison table of mobile phone plans.

*Example scenario:* A price comparison table for gym memberships. The question asks which option includes access to group classes.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Every text on the Lezen exam is something you could realistically encounter while living in the Netherlands. If you've been reading Dutch signs, emails, and flyers in your daily life, you've already been practicing without realizing it.</div>

## How Scoring Works

The Lezen exam uses a standardized scoring system. Here's what you need to know:

- **Each question is worth the same** — there are no "bonus" questions or weighted sections
- **No penalty for wrong answers** — you lose nothing by guessing. Never leave a question blank.
- **The pass mark is approximately 60%** — on a 25-question exam, that means roughly 15 correct answers
- **Results are pass/fail** — you either get a "voldoende" (sufficient) or "onvoldoende" (insufficient). DUO doesn't give you a percentage score or tell you which questions you got wrong.

The 60% threshold is worth thinking about. It means you can get nearly half the questions wrong and still pass. That's a forgiving margin — but it also means the questions aren't all straightforward. Expect a mix of easy, moderate, and tricky questions.

**When do you get results?** DUO typically publishes results within **8 weeks** after your exam date. You can check them through your Mijn Inburgering account. Yes, 8 weeks feels like a long time. Plan around it — don't wait for results before booking your next exam component.

## Question Types and What They're Really Testing

Not all questions are created equal. The Lezen exam tests different reading skills, and understanding which skill each question targets helps you approach it correctly.

### Type 1: Finding Specific Information

The question asks for a specific fact — a date, a price, a name, a time. The answer is stated directly in the text. You just need to find it.

**Strategy:** Scan the text for keywords from the question. The answer is almost always a direct match, not a paraphrase.

### Type 2: Understanding the Main Idea

The question asks what the text is about, what the writer's purpose is, or what the overall message means. You need to understand the text as a whole, not just one detail.

**Strategy:** Read the entire text quickly before looking at the answer options. Ask yourself: what is this text trying to tell me? The correct answer captures the general meaning, not a single detail.

### Type 3: Making Simple Inferences

The answer isn't stated directly in the text, but you can figure it out from the information given. For example, if a job ad says "Experience with children required" and asks who the ad is for, the answer might be "someone who has worked in a school" — even though "school" isn't mentioned in the text.

**Strategy:** Eliminate obviously wrong answers first. The correct answer is the one that logically follows from the text, even if those exact words aren't used.

### Type 4: Understanding Context and Tone

Less common, but it appears: questions about why something was written, who it's aimed at, or what you should do after reading it. These test whether you understand the purpose behind the text.

**Strategy:** Think about the real-world context. Who would write this? Who would read it? What action are they expecting?

## Strategies That Actually Work

Here are the approaches that consistently help people pass the Lezen exam.

### Read the Questions First

This is the single most effective strategy for the Lezen exam. Before reading the passage, read the question (just the question, not the answer options). Now you know what to look for. When you read the text, your brain automatically flags the relevant information.

This works especially well for "finding specific information" questions — you're scanning with purpose instead of reading aimlessly.

### Use Keywords as Anchors

Every question contains keywords — specific nouns, numbers, or names that appear in the text. Find those keywords in the passage, and the answer is usually in the same sentence or the one right next to it.

If the question asks "When is the meeting?" look for words like "vergadering" (meeting) in the text. The time or date will be nearby.

### Eliminate Wrong Answers

On every multiple-choice question, at least one option is clearly wrong if you've understood the text even partially. Cross it out mentally. With 4 options, eliminating one wrong answer and guessing gives you a 33% chance. Eliminating two gives you 50%. That's better than random.

### Don't Overthink It

The Lezen exam is A2 level. The texts are straightforward, and the correct answers are logical. If you find yourself constructing elaborate justifications for an answer, you're probably overthinking it. The simplest, most direct answer is usually correct.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Practice reading Dutch in your daily life — supermarket flyers, gemeente letters, train announcements on screens. This "ambient" practice builds reading speed and familiarity with common Dutch text patterns without requiring dedicated study time.</div>

### Manage Your Time Wisely

You have 65 minutes for about 25 questions. That's plenty — but only if you don't get stuck.

**Recommended approach:**
1. First pass: go through all questions, answer the ones you're confident about (aim for 10-15 minutes)
2. Second pass: tackle the questions you skipped or flagged (15-20 minutes)
3. Review: check your answers, especially the ones you guessed on (remaining time)

If a question is taking more than 3 minutes, mark your best guess and move on. Come back to it later with fresh eyes.

### Pay Attention to Negatives and Qualifiers

Dutch uses negation and qualifiers that can flip the meaning of a sentence. Watch for:
- **niet** (not), **geen** (no/none)
- **alleen** (only), **behalve** (except)
- **wel** (indeed/actually) — often contrasts with a negative
- **nog niet** (not yet) vs. **niet meer** (no longer)

A single "niet" can make the difference between a correct and incorrect answer. Read carefully.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Choosing the answer that uses the same words as the text**

The exam sometimes includes trap answers that repeat exact phrases from the text but answer a different question. The correct answer often paraphrases the text rather than quoting it directly.

**Mistake 2: Answering based on general knowledge instead of the text**

The question asks what the text says, not what you know to be true in general. If the text says the library closes at 17:00 on Fridays, that's the answer — even if you know your local library closes at 20:00.

**Mistake 3: Leaving questions blank**

There is no penalty for wrong answers. A guess gives you a 25-33% chance of being right. A blank answer gives you 0%. Always select something.

**Mistake 4: Spending too long on one question**

Some questions are genuinely hard. They're designed that way — the exam needs a range of difficulty to separate passing from non-passing candidates. Don't let one tough question eat into time you need for easier ones.

## How to Prepare: A Practical Plan

### Step 1: Assess Your Current Level

Take a [free practice reading exam](/try) to see where you stand. If you're scoring above 60% already, you mainly need format familiarity and a bit of polish. Below 40%? You'll want to invest more time in vocabulary building before attempting the real exam.

### Step 2: Build Your Vocabulary

A2 reading requires roughly **1,000-2,000 words** of Dutch vocabulary. Focus on practical, everyday words — the language of signs, emails, ads, and simple instructions. Specialized vocabulary (medical terms, legal jargon) won't appear at A2 level.

High-frequency categories to master:
- Time and dates (maandag, januari, om 14:00, volgende week)
- Locations (kantoor, ziekenhuis, station, gemeente)
- Actions (betalen, bellen, aanmelden, ophalen)
- Descriptions (gratis, verplicht, gesloten, beschikbaar)

### Step 3: Practice With Realistic Exam Questions

The more exam-style questions you practice, the more automatic your reading strategies become. Our [Lezen practice module](/learn/lezen/exam) uses the same format as the real DUO exam — short passages with multiple-choice questions at A2 level.

Aim for at least 3-4 full practice sessions before booking your real exam. Track your scores. You should be consistently hitting 70%+ in practice before scheduling the real thing (the extra 10% buffer accounts for exam-day nerves).

### Step 4: Read Dutch Every Day

Dedicated study time matters, but passive exposure matters too. Set your phone language to Dutch. Read the free newspapers (Metro) on public transport. Skim the Albert Heijn bonus folder. Every bit of Dutch text your eyes process builds speed and pattern recognition.

### Step 5: Book and Sit the Exam

Once you're consistently passing practice tests, book your exam through [Mijn Inburgering](https://inburgeren.nl). Choose a date that gives you at least 2 more weeks of practice after booking. Arrive early, bring your ID, and trust your preparation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use a dictionary during the Lezen exam?

No. No dictionaries, no phones, no notes, no translation tools. The exam tests your unaided reading ability. Everything you need to answer the questions is in the text.

### What language are the questions written in?

The questions and answer options are in Dutch. The entire exam — texts, questions, instructions — is in Dutch. There's no English translation available during the test.

### Are the texts the same for everyone?

Not exactly. DUO uses multiple exam versions to prevent cheating. The difficulty level and text types are comparable, but you and the person sitting next to you will likely have different passages and questions.

### How soon can I retake the Lezen exam if I fail?

You can rebook after approximately **2 weeks**. Use that time to study — don't just rebook immediately and hope for an easier version. Identify where you struggled and target those areas.

### Should I take Lezen first or save it?

Many people take Lezen as their first exam component, and that's a solid strategy. It tends to be the least intimidating (no speaking or writing under pressure), and passing your first component builds confidence for the rest. Pair it with our [30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) for a structured approach.

## Your Next Steps

The Lezen exam is very passable with the right preparation. The texts are short, the questions are multiple-choice, and the time limit is generous. What separates people who pass from those who don't isn't intelligence or talent — it's familiarity with the format and consistent practice.

Here's how to get started:

1. **Take a practice exam** — [try a free reading assessment](/try) to benchmark your level
2. **Practice with real formats** — work through our [Lezen practice module](/learn/lezen/exam) with exam-style passages and questions
3. **Build your study plan** — use our [30-day study guide](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) to structure your preparation across all components
4. **Understand the full exam** — read our [exam walkthrough](/blog/inburgering-exam-walkthrough-2026) to know what to expect across all six components

You read this entire article in English. In a few weeks of practice, you'll be reading similar-length texts in Dutch. That's the A2 level — closer than you think.
