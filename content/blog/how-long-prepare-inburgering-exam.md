# How Long Does It Take to Prepare for the Inburgering Exam?

This is the first question everyone types into Google. And the answer you'll find on most websites is some version of "it depends" followed by a wall of vague advice.

Let's do better than that.

The honest answer: **somewhere between 2 weeks and 6 months**, depending on where you're starting from. That range sounds enormous, but it narrows fast once you know three things: your current Dutch level, how many hours a week you can study, and whether you understand the difference between learning Dutch and preparing for the exam.

That last point is the one most people miss entirely. We'll get to it.

## The Two Things People Confuse: Learning Dutch vs. Exam Prep

Here's something that saves people weeks of wasted effort: **learning Dutch and preparing for the inburgering exam are two different activities.** They overlap, but they're not the same.

Learning Dutch means building vocabulary, understanding grammar, getting comfortable with the language. It's open-ended. You could spend years on it and still feel like you're not ready.

Exam prep means understanding exactly what DUO tests, how they test it, and what score you need. It's targeted. The inburgering language exams are all at **A2 level** — the second-lowest tier on the European language framework. You don't need to be good at Dutch. You need to be good enough to pass specific exam formats at a specific level.

If you already speak some Dutch — even broken, kitchen-table Dutch — most of your time should go toward exam prep, not language learning. You're closer to A2 than you think. The gap between "I can survive in Dutch" and "I can pass an A2 exam" is smaller than it feels.

If you're starting from zero Dutch, you need both: language foundations first, then exam prep layered on top.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Don't spend months perfecting your Dutch before starting exam prep. The exam tests A2-level skills in very specific formats. Start practicing those formats early, even if your Dutch feels shaky.</div>

## Realistic Timelines by Starting Level

Your preparation timeline depends almost entirely on where you're starting. Here are four common profiles and what each one actually looks like.

### Profile 1: Complete Beginner (Zero Dutch)

**Timeline: 3-6 months**

You just arrived in the Netherlands, or you've been here a while but never learned any Dutch because everyone speaks English. You can say "hallo" and "dank je wel" and that's about it.

You need to build language skills from scratch before exam prep makes sense. That means:

- **Months 1-3:** Basic Dutch through a course, app, or self-study. Get to the point where you can read simple texts and understand slow, clear speech. Duolingo or Babbel work fine here — they'll get you the foundation.
- **Months 3-5:** Transition to exam-specific prep. Start doing [practice exams](/try) to learn the formats. Study KNM topics. Practice writing short emails and speaking responses.
- **Month 5-6:** Full exam simulation mode. Timed practice. Weak spot drilling.

Expect to invest **200-300 total hours** across both phases.

### Profile 2: Some Dutch (Basic Conversations)

**Timeline: 4-8 weeks**

You've picked up Dutch from daily life — ordering at the bakker, reading emails from your gemeente, following along in simple conversations. You can read basic texts if you go slowly. Your grammar is messy and your vocabulary has gaps, but the foundation exists.

This is where most expats who've lived in the Netherlands for 1-2 years land. Good news: you're already at or near A2 in comprehension. What you need is:

- **Weeks 1-2:** Take diagnostic practice exams in every component. Find your weak spots. Most people in this group score well on Lezen and Luisteren but struggle with Schrijven and Spreken.
- **Weeks 3-5:** Targeted practice on weak components plus KNM study.
- **Weeks 6-8:** Full timed practice exams. Polish. Build confidence.

Total investment: **80-120 hours.**

### Profile 3: Kennismigrant with Decent Dutch

**Timeline: 2-4 weeks**

You're a knowledge migrant. You've been here a couple of years, you speak Dutch at work sometimes, you can read the news if you focus, and you can hold a conversation — not perfectly, but functionally. Your Dutch friends have stopped switching to English.

You don't need much language learning. You need **pure exam prep**:

- **Week 1:** Do practice exams for all components. You'll probably pass Lezen and Luisteren right away. Note exactly where you lose points.
- **Week 2:** Hammer KNM topics (this is the one that catches kennismigranten off guard). Practice Schrijven format.
- **Weeks 3-4:** Spreken practice and full timed mock exams. Schedule your real exams.

Total investment: **40-60 hours.**

### Profile 4: German or Afrikaans Speaker

**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

Dutch and German share roughly 80% of their core vocabulary. Afrikaans is even closer — it literally evolved from Dutch. If you speak either of these languages, A2 Dutch is remarkably accessible. You'll read Dutch texts and understand 60-70% on day one.

Your challenge isn't the language — it's the false friends (words that look similar but mean something different) and the KNM content. Focus on:

- **Days 1-3:** Practice exams to establish your baseline. Read up on Dutch-German false friends.
- **Week 1-2:** KNM study (this is pure memorization, no language advantage here). Practice Schrijven and Spreken formats.
- **Week 2-3:** Mock exams under real conditions. Book your DUO slots.

Total investment: **30-50 hours.**

## Which Components Take the Longest?

Not all six components require equal prep time. Here's how they typically break down, from most to least time-intensive:

| Component | Typical Prep Time | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **KNM** (Society Knowledge) | 15-25 hours | Pure memorization. 8 topics, lots of specific facts. No shortcuts. |
| **Schrijven** (Writing) | 12-20 hours | Active production at A2. You need to practice the specific formats (emails, forms, short messages). |
| **Spreken** (Speaking) | 10-18 hours | Most people avoid this because it's uncomfortable. That avoidance adds weeks. |
| **Lezen** (Reading) | 8-12 hours | Passive comprehension. If you live in the Netherlands, you're already reading Dutch daily. |
| **Luisteren** (Listening) | 8-12 hours | Same as Lezen — passive skill. Practice with the exam audio format. |
| **ONA** | 2-5 hours | Portfolio-based, not an exam. Gather your documents and submit. |

The pattern is clear: **active skills (writing, speaking) take longer than passive skills (reading, listening), and KNM takes everyone longer than expected.** Most people underestimate KNM because they think living in the Netherlands means they know how Dutch society works. Knowing how to visit your huisarts is different from knowing what the POH does, what Keti Koti commemorates, or how the Tweede Kamer forms a coalition.

## Quick Self-Assessment: Estimate Your Timeline

Answer these five questions honestly, then add up your score.

**1. Can you read a simple Dutch email (from your gemeente or health insurer) and understand the main point?**
- Yes, easily → 0 points
- With some effort and a dictionary → 2 points
- Not at all → 5 points

**2. Can you follow a slow, clear Dutch conversation about everyday topics?**
- Yes → 0 points
- Partially — I catch the main idea → 2 points
- No → 5 points

**3. Could you write a short email in Dutch (5-6 sentences) to cancel an appointment?**
- Yes, with some mistakes → 0 points
- I could try, but it would be rough → 3 points
- Definitely not → 5 points

**4. Could you introduce yourself in Dutch and describe your daily routine in 8-10 sentences?**
- Yes → 0 points
- A few sentences, then I'd switch to English → 3 points
- No → 5 points

**5. Do you know what DigiD is, how Dutch health insurance works, and what happens at a huisartsenpost?**
- Yes to all three → 0 points
- One or two of those → 2 points
- None of them → 4 points

**Your score:**

| Score | Estimated Timeline | Hours Per Week Needed |
|---|---|---|
| 0-4 | 2-4 weeks | 8-10 |
| 5-10 | 4-8 weeks | 6-10 |
| 11-18 | 2-4 months | 5-8 |
| 19-24 | 4-6 months | 5-10 |

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Whatever your score, start with a <a href="/try">free practice exam</a> to see where you actually stand. Your gut feeling about your Dutch level and your actual exam performance are often very different things.</div>

## How Study Hours Per Week Change Your Timeline

The timelines above assume you can dedicate meaningful hours each week. But life gets in the way — work, kids, social commitments, the general chaos of living abroad. Here's how your weekly study capacity shifts the math.

For someone at the **"some Dutch" level** (Profile 2, ~100 hours needed):

| Hours Per Week | Timeline |
|---|---|
| 15+ hours (intensive) | 6-7 weeks |
| 10 hours | 8-10 weeks |
| 7 hours | 12-14 weeks |
| 5 hours | 16-20 weeks |
| 3 hours | 6-8 months |

There's a minimum effective dose here. Below about 3 hours per week, retention drops off sharply. You spend most of each session re-learning what you forgot since last time. If you can only do 3 hours a week, make them count — do one focused hour three times rather than one marathon session.

On the other end, studying more than 2-3 hours in a single session has diminishing returns for language skills. Your brain needs time to process. Short, frequent sessions beat long, occasional ones every time.

## The Fastest Path to Passing

If you want to minimize total prep time, here's the approach that works:

**Step 1: Diagnose before you study.** Take practice exams for every component on day one. You might already pass some of them. Many professionals score 70%+ on Lezen and Luisteren without any preparation — that's time you don't need to spend.

**Step 2: Study the exam, not just the language.** Learn the specific formats DUO uses. The Schrijven exam expects certain email structures. The Spreken exam follows a predictable pattern. The KNM has specific topics. Understanding what's tested lets you prepare surgically.

**Step 3: Front-load KNM.** It's the component with the most raw content to memorize, and it has nothing to do with your Dutch ability. Start studying KNM topics in week one and review them consistently.

**Step 4: Practice speaking from day one.** Don't save Spreken for last. Record yourself answering prompts daily, even for just 5 minutes. The embarrassment factor fades fast, and speaking skills take the longest to build.

**Step 5: Simulate real conditions.** Timed practice exams under quiet, focused conditions — not at a cafe with headphones. The real exam is stressful. Make your practice stressful too.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I prepare for the inburgering exam in 2 weeks?

Yes — if you already speak decent Dutch (Profile 3 or 4 above). A kennismigrant with solid conversational Dutch and some focused study time can realistically prepare in 2-3 weeks. If you're a complete beginner, 2 weeks is not realistic. Be honest about your starting level.

### Is it faster to take a course or self-study?

For most professionals, **self-study is faster.** Courses move at the pace of the slowest student in the class. If your Lezen is already strong but your Schrijven needs work, a course wastes time on what you already know. Self-study lets you target exactly what needs improvement. That said, courses can help if you need the structure and accountability.

### Should I prepare for all components at the same time or one by one?

**Study in parallel, but book exams strategically.** Your reading and listening practice reinforces each other. KNM study reinforces your reading skills. Working on everything simultaneously creates useful overlap. But when booking exams, schedule your strongest components first to build confidence.

### How do I know when I'm ready to book the real exam?

When you can consistently score **70% or higher** on [practice exams](/try) under timed conditions. The pass mark is around 60%, but aiming for 70% gives you a safety margin for exam-day nerves. If you're hitting 70%+ three times in a row, book it.

### Does it take longer under Wi2021 than Wi2013?

The Wi2021 pathway targets **B1 level** (one step above A2), which does require more language ability. If you're under Wi2021, expect roughly **30-50% more prep time** for the language components. Check which law applies to you — most kennismigranten voluntarily integrating fall under Wi2013 and only need A2. Read our [guide for professionals](/blog/inburgering-exam-guide-professionals-2026) if you're unsure which law applies.

## Stop Researching, Start Practicing

Here's the thing about timelines: reading about how long it takes doesn't get you any closer to passing. The single best thing you can do right now is take a [free practice exam](/try) and find out exactly where you stand. Ten minutes of real practice tells you more than ten hours of research.

Once you know your baseline, check out our [A2 Dutch level explainer](/blog/a2-dutch-level-explained-inburgering) to understand exactly what you're aiming for, then follow the [30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) to get there.

The exam isn't going anywhere. But your deadline might be closer than you think.
