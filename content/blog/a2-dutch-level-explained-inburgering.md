# A2 Dutch: What Does It Actually Mean and How Good Do You Need to Be?

Everyone preparing for the inburgering exam hears the same phrase: "You need A2 level Dutch." Then they Google "A2 Dutch" and find a vague EU framework description about "basic needs" and "routine tasks." That doesn't help when you're trying to figure out whether you're ready for an exam.

So let's make it concrete. What can you actually *do* at A2? What does A2 Dutch sound like, read like, feel like in practice? And most importantly — is your Dutch good enough right now, or do you have work to do?

This guide breaks down A2 in real, practical terms. No academic jargon. Just a clear picture of the bar you need to clear and how to know when you've cleared it.

## The CEFR Scale: Where A2 Sits

The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) is the system Europe uses to describe language ability. It has six levels:

| Level | Label | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Beginner | Can handle very basic interactions — greetings, simple questions, ordering food |
| **A2** | **Elementary** | **Can handle routine everyday situations — shopping, appointments, simple conversations** |
| B1 | Intermediate | Can deal with most situations while traveling, express opinions, describe experiences |
| B2 | Upper Intermediate | Can interact fluently with native speakers, understand complex texts |
| C1 | Advanced | Can use language flexibly for social, academic, and professional purposes |
| C2 | Mastery | Near-native fluency |

**A2 is the second level from the bottom.** That's not said to make it sound easy — it's said to recalibrate your expectations. The inburgering exam doesn't require you to debate Dutch politics, understand literary novels, or write business reports in Dutch. It requires you to function in basic everyday situations.

Think of it this way: A1 is "tourist Dutch." A2 is "I live here and can handle daily life Dutch." B1 is "I can actually have a real conversation Dutch."

## What You Can Do at A2 (With Real Examples)

Abstract descriptions don't help. Here's what A2 looks like in the four language skills — reading, listening, writing, and speaking — with examples of what you can and can't handle at this level.

### Reading at A2

**You can read:**
- A short email from your child's school about a parent evening
- A job posting on a notice board
- The opening hours and rules at a swimming pool
- A letter from your municipality about garbage collection days
- Menu items at a restaurant (though you might not know every ingredient)
- Simple instructions on a medicine package

**You struggle with:**
- A full newspaper article about politics or economics
- Legal documents (rental contracts, terms and conditions)
- Texts with lots of abstract vocabulary or figurative language
- Long, complex sentences with multiple subordinate clauses

**Example of an A2-readable text:**

> *Beste ouders, Volgende week donderdag is er een ouderavond op school. De avond begint om 19:30 uur in de aula. U kunt met de leerkracht praten over uw kind. Koffie en thee zijn gratis. Graag aanmelden via de e-mail van de school.*

At A2, you understand: there's a parent evening next Thursday at 19:30, it's in the aula, you can talk to the teacher, and you need to sign up by email. You might not catch every word, but you get the message. That's A2 reading.

### Listening at A2

**You can understand:**
- Simple announcements at a train station ("The train to Amsterdam departs from platform 3")
- A cashier asking if you need a bag
- Your huisarts explaining that you need to take medicine twice a day
- A coworker asking about your weekend plans
- Basic phone conversations when the other person speaks clearly

**You struggle with:**
- Fast-paced group conversations where people talk over each other
- Dutch TV shows or movies with slang and colloquial speech
- Phone calls with background noise or poor audio quality
- Regional accents (Brabants, Limburgs, Gronings)
- Sarcasm and humor that relies on cultural context

**The gap between study Dutch and real Dutch:** If you've learned Dutch primarily through apps or textbooks, natural-speed spoken Dutch will feel fast. At A2, you can follow clear, standard Dutch at a moderate pace. Real-world Dutch — the way people actually talk — requires your A2 skills to be solid, not just passing.

### Writing at A2

**You can write:**
- A short email to cancel an appointment: *"Beste mevrouw Jansen, Ik kan helaas niet komen op dinsdag 15 maart. Kan ik een nieuwe afspraak maken? Met vriendelijke groet, [naam]"*
- A note to your child's teacher explaining an absence
- A simple complaint or request
- Basic forms — name, address, date of birth, reason for visit

**You struggle with:**
- Formal letters with proper structure and tone
- Expressing complex opinions or arguments in writing
- Using correct word order in longer sentences
- De/het articles consistently (honestly, even B1 learners struggle with this)

**The A2 writing principle:** Short and correct beats long and wrong. Five simple sentences that clearly communicate your message score better on the Schrijven exam than two paragraphs full of grammar errors. At A2, nobody expects elegance. They expect clarity.

### Speaking at A2

**You can say:**
- Where you live and what you do for work
- What you did last weekend (in simple terms)
- Ask for directions or information at a service desk
- Order food and make simple requests
- Describe someone's appearance or a place in basic terms

**You struggle with:**
- Telling a story with proper past tenses and sequence
- Expressing opinions with nuance ("I partly agree, but...")
- Speaking spontaneously about unfamiliar topics
- Quick back-and-forth conversation at native speed

**The pronunciation factor:** At A2, your pronunciation doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be understandable. Dutch-specific sounds like the hard "g," the "ui" diphthong, and the "sch" combination can be tricky, but examiners are used to accented Dutch. Clarity matters more than a perfect accent.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> A2 is not "fluent." It's not even "good." It's "functional." You can handle the basic situations of daily life in the Netherlands — and that's exactly what the inburgering exam tests. Don't set the bar at fluency. Set it at A2.</div>

## A2 vs. B1: What's the Difference?

Some inburgering candidates — particularly those under the Wi2021 regulation — may need to reach **B1** level for certain components. Understanding the gap between A2 and B1 helps you gauge where you are.

| Skill | A2 | B1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Reading** | Short, simple, practical texts | Longer texts with some complexity; can understand main points of a newspaper article |
| **Listening** | Clear, slow-to-moderate speech on familiar topics | Standard speech at normal pace; can follow the main points of a news broadcast |
| **Writing** | Short notes, emails, simple forms | Connected text on familiar topics; can write a personal letter describing experiences |
| **Speaking** | Simple exchanges on familiar topics | Can describe experiences, give opinions, explain plans in connected speech |

The jump from A2 to B1 is significant. A2 is about handling predictable, routine situations. B1 is about coping with unpredictable situations and expressing your own thoughts. Going from A2 to B1 typically takes **200-300 additional hours** of study.

**If you only need A2** (Wi2013 regulation — most inburgering candidates), don't waste time trying to reach B1. Get solid at A2, pass your exams, and then improve your Dutch naturally through daily life.

**If you need B1** (Wi2021 or certain pathways), plan for a longer preparation period and consider formal language classes in addition to self-study.

## How to Self-Assess Your Dutch Level

You probably already have a rough idea of your level, but confirmation bias is real. People who are A1 sometimes think they're A2 because they can order coffee. People who are solidly A2 sometimes think they're still A1 because they can't follow a native-speed conversation.

Here's a practical self-assessment:

### Quick Level Check

Answer honestly:

**A1 indicators (you're not quite at A2 yet):**
- You can only speak in the present tense
- You rely heavily on English when things get complicated
- Reading a short Dutch email takes you several minutes with a dictionary
- You can't understand your huisarts without switching to English

**A2 indicators (you're at the exam level):**
- You can write a simple email in Dutch without Google Translate
- You understand the main point of a short Dutch text on the first read
- You can have a basic conversation with your neighbor — not deep, but functional
- You can fill out a Dutch form without help
- You understand announcements at the train station
- You can talk about your daily routine, your job, and your family in simple terms

**B1 indicators (you're above the minimum):**
- You can read a short news article and understand most of it
- You can follow a Dutch TV show without subtitles (at least the main plot)
- You can express opinions: "I think... because..."
- You can handle an unexpected phone call in Dutch without panicking

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The most reliable self-assessment method is to <a href="/try">take a practice exam</a>. If you score above 60% consistently on reading and listening practice, you're at A2. Below 50%? You need more study time. Between 50-60%? You're close — focused practice will get you there.</div>

## The "Feeling" Gap: Why A2 Doesn't Feel Like Enough

Here's something nobody warns you about: **A2 doesn't feel fluent.** Not even close. At A2, you'll still have moments where you blank on a word mid-sentence. You'll still misunderstand things. You'll still feel awkward speaking Dutch in front of native speakers.

That's normal. That IS A2.

The danger is letting that feeling of inadequacy convince you that you're not ready for the exam. Many candidates postpone their exams month after month, thinking "I need to get better first." They're chasing a feeling of confidence that doesn't arrive until B1 or B2 — levels far beyond what the exam requires.

The inburgering exam at A2 is testing whether you can:
- Read a short notice and understand what it says
- Listen to a simple conversation and get the main point
- Write a basic email that makes sense
- Speak about everyday topics clearly enough to be understood

That's it. You don't need to feel confident. You need to be functional. There's a real difference.

## Closing the Gap: From A1 to A2

If you've assessed yourself at A1 and need to reach A2, here's the practical path. The jump from A1 to A2 typically takes **150-200 hours** of focused study, depending on your native language and learning environment.

**What to focus on:**

**Vocabulary (most important at this stage):**
- Target **1,000-1,500 words** — not random words, but the most common ones used in daily Dutch life
- Focus on topic clusters: healthcare, shopping, work, transportation, housing, school/children
- Learn words in context (short sentences), not as isolated flashcards

**Grammar (keep it simple):**
- Present tense (regular and common irregular verbs)
- Simple past tense (imperfectum) for common verbs
- Basic word order: subject-verb-object in main clauses
- Question formation
- Common modal verbs: *kunnen, willen, moeten, mogen*
- Separable verbs (the bane of every Dutch learner's existence)

**Reading practice:**
- Read Dutch children's books (Level A2 corresponds roughly to books for 8-10 year olds)
- Practice with NOS Kids articles — real news in simple language
- Do reading practice exams to get used to the format and question types

**Listening practice:**
- Watch NOS Journaal with Dutch subtitles — 10 minutes daily makes a real difference over a month
- Listen to Dutch podcasts designed for learners (Zeg Het In Het Nederlands, Nederlandse Taal Café)
- Practice with listening exam clips to calibrate your ear to the test format

**Speaking practice:**
- Talk to yourself in Dutch (seriously — narrate your daily routine while commuting or showering)
- Find a language exchange partner through apps like Tandem or HelloTalk
- Record yourself and listen back. You'll notice improvement faster than you think.

**Writing practice:**
- Write one short Dutch email per day — even if it's to yourself
- Practice filling out forms: naam, adres, geboortedatum, reden van bezoek
- Try the [Schrijven practice tasks](/learn/schrijven) to match the exam format

## What A2 Means for Each Exam Component

The A2 requirement applies differently to each language component of the inburgering exam:

**Lezen (Reading):** You need to understand short everyday texts. The passages are designed for A2 readers — short sentences, common vocabulary, practical topics. If you can read and understand the example school email earlier in this article, you're in the right range. Check our [detailed Lezen exam guide](/blog/lezen-reading-exam-format-scoring) for specifics.

**Luisteren (Listening):** You need to understand clear, standard Dutch spoken at a moderate pace. The audio clips are professionally recorded with clear diction — not mumbly street Dutch. You get to listen to each clip twice, which significantly reduces the difficulty.

**Schrijven (Writing):** You need to produce simple written Dutch. The tasks are practical — emails, notes, forms. Perfect grammar isn't required. Communication is. If the examiner can understand your message and you've addressed the task, you're in good shape.

**Spreken (Speaking):** You need to speak clearly enough to be understood. Fluency matters more than accuracy at A2. A confident answer with minor errors scores better than a technically perfect answer delivered in fragments with long pauses.

**KNM:** Not a language exam — it tests knowledge of Dutch society. But the questions are written in Dutch, so you need enough reading comprehension to understand them. If you're at A2 in reading, you can handle the KNM question language.

## How Long Does It Take to Reach A2?

Starting from zero Dutch? The CEFR estimates approximately **200-250 hours** of guided learning to reach A2. But that varies enormously based on:

**Factors that speed you up:**
- Your native language is close to Dutch (German, Afrikaans, Scandinavian languages)
- You live in the Netherlands and interact in Dutch daily
- You have experience learning other languages
- You're studying intensively (2+ hours daily) rather than casually

**Factors that slow you down:**
- Your native language is distant from Dutch (Arabic, Mandarin, Thai, Indonesian)
- You work in English and socialize in English — your Dutch exposure is limited
- You only study a few hours per week
- You focus too much on grammar theory and not enough on practice

**Realistic timelines:**

| Starting Point | Daily Study | Time to A2 |
|---|---|---|
| Zero Dutch, similar language background | 1-2 hours | 3-4 months |
| Zero Dutch, distant language background | 1-2 hours | 5-8 months |
| Some Dutch (A1), any background | 1-2 hours | 2-3 months |
| Living in NL 1+ years with passive exposure | 1-2 hours | 1-2 months |

If you're already at A1 and have been living in the Netherlands, the [30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) is built exactly for your situation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is A2 really enough to live in the Netherlands?

For daily basics — yes. For a fulfilling social and professional life — you'll want more over time. A2 gets you through the exam and handles routine situations. Most expats naturally improve beyond A2 through daily life, work, and social interactions. The exam is a baseline, not a ceiling.

### My Dutch friends say my Dutch is "good" — does that mean I'm at A2?

Maybe, maybe not. Dutch people are famously encouraging about language attempts. "Oh, your Dutch is so good!" often means "I appreciate that you're trying." The only reliable way to know your level is to test it. [Take a practice exam](/try) — your score won't sugarcoat your ability.

### I can understand Dutch better than I can speak it. Is that normal?

Completely normal. Receptive skills (reading and listening) develop faster than productive skills (writing and speaking) in every language. This is actually good news for the inburgering exam — two of the four language components (Lezen and Luisteren) test receptive skills. Play to your strengths and pass those first, then focus on Schrijven and Spreken.

### Does the 30% ruling exempt me from needing A2?

The 30% ruling itself doesn't exempt you from inburgering. However, kennismigranten (highly skilled migrants) on the 30% ruling may be exempt from the inburgering requirement altogether depending on their nationality and circumstances. Check your specific situation — the exemption is about your residence permit type, not your language level.

### What if I'm already at B1 or higher?

Then you're over-prepared for the A2 exam, which is a good problem to have. Take a practice exam to confirm, and then you can spend your study time on KNM (knowledge) rather than language preparation. You'll breeze through the language components.
