# Inburgering for Kennismigranten: Do 30% Ruling Holders Need to Integrate?

The short answer is no — if you're on a kennismigrant visa with the 30% ruling, you don't *have* to do inburgering. Nobody's going to knock on your door and hand you a deadline letter from DUO.

But here's the thing: that exemption only covers the *mandatory* civic integration requirement. It doesn't help you one bit when you want permanent residence (PR) or Dutch citizenship. For those, you'll need the inburgeringsdiploma — and there's no shortcut around it.

So the real question isn't "do I have to?" It's "when should I start?"

## What Does the 30% Ruling Exemption Actually Cover?

When people talk about being "exempt from inburgering," they're usually mixing up two very different things. Let's untangle them.

**The mandatory inburgering obligation** is a legal requirement that applies to most non-EU/EEA nationals who come to the Netherlands. If you fall under it, you get a letter from DUO, a deadline (usually 3 years), and potential fines if you don't comply. This is the obligation that kennismigranten and 30% ruling holders are exempt from.

**The inburgeringsdiploma as a requirement for PR or citizenship** is a completely separate gate. The IND requires it as part of your application, and your kennismigrant status doesn't waive it.

Here's a quick breakdown:

| Scenario | Mandatory Inburgering? | Need Inburgeringsdiploma? |
|---|---|---|
| Stay in NL on kennismigrant visa indefinitely | No | No |
| Apply for permanent residence (PR) | No | **Yes** |
| Apply for Dutch citizenship/naturalization | No | **Yes** |
| Switch to a different visa category | Depends on new category | Possibly |

So the 30% ruling exemption is real, but it's narrower than most people think. It keeps DUO off your back. It doesn't open the door to PR or a Dutch passport.

## Which Law Applies to You: Wi2013 or Wi2021?

This is where a lot of kennismigranten get confused — and where some expensive mistakes happen.

The Netherlands has two inburgering frameworks running in parallel right now:

- **Wi2013** (Wet inburgering 2013) — applies to people who arrived before January 1, 2022, *and* to people who voluntarily inburger (like kennismigranten choosing to do it for PR/citizenship)
- **Wi2021** (Wet inburgering 2021) — the newer, stricter framework that applies to people with a mandatory inburgering obligation who arrived on or after January 1, 2022

Here's the part that matters: **as a kennismigrant doing inburgering voluntarily, you fall under Wi2013, regardless of when you arrived.** Even if you moved here in 2024 or 2025, you're still taking exams under the older framework.

Why does this matter? Because Wi2013 requires **A2-level** Dutch. Wi2021 requires **B1-level** Dutch.

The difference is significant:

| Level | Vocabulary | What It Means in Practice |
|---|---|---|
| **A2** (Wi2013) | ~1,000-2,000 words | Simple conversations, short texts, basic daily situations |
| **B1** (Wi2021) | ~3,000+ words | Extended conversations, longer articles, expressing opinions |

**A2 is significantly more achievable than B1.** You're looking at roughly half the vocabulary and much simpler grammar structures. For a busy professional juggling a demanding job, this is a huge difference in study time.

Spoiler alert: this is one of the biggest advantages kennismigranten have, and most don't even know about it.

## When Should You Start Thinking About Inburgering?

If you're planning to stay in the Netherlands long-term — and let's be honest, if you're reading this, you probably are — the timeline matters more than you'd think.

**For permanent residence, you need 5 years of continuous legal residence.** You can apply a few months before you hit the 5-year mark. But you need your inburgeringsdiploma *before* or *at the time of* your PR application.

Here's the timeline most kennismigranten should aim for:

- **Year 1-2:** Settle in. Focus on your job. Pick up Dutch casually if you want, but don't stress about exams yet.
- **Year 3:** Start studying for inburgering. At A2 level, most structured learners need **3-6 months** of consistent practice.
- **Year 4:** Take and pass your exams. Give yourself buffer time in case you need to retake a component.
- **Year 4.5-5:** Apply for PR with your inburgeringsdiploma in hand.

The mistake people make? Waiting until year 4.5, panicking, and then trying to cram everything in 6 weeks. It's doable at A2, but it's not fun — and failing a component means waiting weeks for a retake slot.

**Start in year 3. Thank yourself in year 5.**

If you're going for Dutch citizenship instead of (or in addition to) PR, the residency requirement is also 5 years, and you'll need the inburgeringsdiploma the same way. The citizenship process has additional requirements like renouncing your original nationality in some cases, but the inburgering part is identical.

## What Do the A2 Exams Actually Look Like?

The inburgering exam isn't one big test — it's **six separate components**. You register and take each one individually at DUO exam locations around the country.

Here's what you're signing up for:

**1. KNM (Kennis van de Nederlandse Maatschappij)**
Knowledge of Dutch Society. **40 multiple-choice questions** about how the Netherlands works — healthcare, government, education, housing, work culture, history, geography. This is the component most expats find either surprisingly interesting or mind-numbingly specific. Topics like how to register with a huisarts or what Prinsjesdag is about.

For a deep dive on this one, check out our [KNM exam format guide](/blog/knm-exam-2026-new-format).

**2. Lezen (Reading)**
Reading comprehension at A2 level. Short texts — think signs, emails, simple articles — with multiple-choice questions. If you can read a supermarket flyer or a brief email from your gemeente, you're in the right ballpark.

**3. Luisteren (Listening)**
Listen to short Dutch conversations and audio clips, then answer multiple-choice questions. Everyday scenarios: at the doctor, on the phone, at work.

**4. Schrijven (Writing)**
Write short texts — typically an email, a form, a message to a landlord, or a reply to a colleague. At A2, you don't need perfect grammar. You need to communicate the right information clearly.

**5. Spreken (Speaking)**
A computer-based speaking test. You'll respond to prompts out loud, and your speech is recorded and graded. Topics cover daily life situations.

**6. ONA (Oriëntatie op de Nederlandse Arbeidsmarkt)**
Orientation on the Dutch labor market. This is a portfolio-based component — you document activities related to understanding the Dutch job market. As a kennismigrant who's already employed in the Netherlands, this one is usually straightforward.

## How Much Does It All Cost?

One of the nice things about doing inburgering voluntarily: you're not under a financial gun. But the costs are still worth knowing upfront so you can budget.

**Exam fees (paid to DUO):**

| Component | Approximate Fee |
|---|---|
| KNM | ~€50 |
| Lezen (Reading) | ~€50 |
| Luisteren (Listening) | ~€50 |
| Schrijven (Writing) | ~€50 |
| Spreken (Speaking) | ~€50 |
| ONA | ~€50 |
| **Total exam fees** | **~€300-350** |

These fees are per attempt. If you fail a component, you pay again for the retake.

**Study materials and preparation:**

| Approach | Approximate Cost | Time Investment |
|---|---|---|
| Self-study (books + free resources) | €50-150 | Higher (you're building your own structure) |
| Online practice platform | €0-30/month | Efficient (structured, exam-focused) |
| Private tutor | €30-60/hour | Fastest for weak areas |
| Language school course | €500-2,000+ | Most structured, least flexible |

For kennismigranten earning €80K+, the total cost of inburgering is relatively minor. **The real cost is your time.** That's why optimizing your study approach matters — you want to pass efficiently, not spend months on material you don't need.

## Strategies That Work for Busy Kennismigranten

You didn't get a kennismigrant visa by being bad at passing tests. Here's how to apply that same structured approach to inburgering:

**Focus on KNM first.** It's entirely in English-friendly territory for studying (many resources available in English), and it's pure knowledge — no language production required. You can knock this out in 2-4 weeks of focused study. [Practice KNM questions here](/learn/knm) to see the format.

**Don't overprepare for language components.** A2 is not fluent Dutch. It's "can you survive basic daily interactions?" If you've been living in the Netherlands for 3+ years and make any effort to speak Dutch, you're closer than you think.

**Take the exam components separately.** You don't have to do all six on the same day or even the same month. Many people spread them across 2-3 months. Knock out the easy wins first (KNM, ONA), then focus your energy on the components that need more work.

**Use your commute.** Listening practice on the train. Flashcard apps during lunch. 20 minutes a day of structured practice adds up fast over 3 months.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I apply for PR without the inburgeringsdiploma if I have the 30% ruling?

No. The 30% ruling exempts you from the *mandatory inburgering obligation* (the one with deadlines and fines from DUO). It does **not** exempt you from the IND's requirement to have an inburgeringsdiploma when applying for permanent residence or citizenship.

### What if my 30% ruling gets shortened or ends — do I suddenly need to inburger?

The end of your 30% ruling doesn't automatically trigger a mandatory inburgering obligation. Your exemption from mandatory inburgering is tied to your kennismigrant residence permit, not the tax ruling. However, if your visa status changes (for example, you switch from a kennismigrant permit to a partner permit), different rules may apply.

### I already have a university degree from the Netherlands — do I still need to do inburgering for PR?

Possibly not. If you have a Dutch degree (HBO or WO level) or a degree from a designated institution where the program was taught in Dutch, you may be able to get a dispensation. Check with the IND directly, as the rules around educational exemptions are specific.

### Is there a time limit for passing all the exam components?

Under Wi2013 (which applies to voluntary inburgeraars), there's no strict deadline like the 3-year window that mandatory inburgeraars face. You can take the components at your own pace. That said, don't let this become an excuse to procrastinate — exam formats and requirements can change, and you want your PR application timeline to stay on track.

### Can I take the inburgering exam at B1 level instead of A2?

You can, but there's no advantage for PR or citizenship purposes. Passing at A2 under Wi2013 gives you the same inburgeringsdiploma. Unless you want the personal challenge or need B1 certification for other reasons, stick with A2 and save yourself the extra study time.
