# Inburgering Exam Costs in 2026: Full Breakdown of Fees

One of the first questions everyone asks when they start the inburgering process: *how much is this going to cost me?*

The honest answer: less than you'd think for the exams themselves, but more than you'd expect once you factor in everything else. A single exam component costs under €55. The full set of six? Just under €300. But study materials, travel to exam centers, potential retakes, and the eventual IND application fee push the real total higher.

This guide breaks down every cost associated with the inburgering exams in 2026 — the obvious fees, the hidden ones, and the ways to keep the total as low as possible.

## DUO Exam Fees: The Official Costs

All inburgering exams are administered by **DUO** (Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs). You register and pay through the [Mijn Inburgering portal](https://inburgeren.nl) using your DigiD. Each component is booked and paid for separately.

Here's what each component costs as of 2026:

| Exam Component | Fee per Attempt |
|---|---|
| **Lezen** (Reading) | €48 |
| **Luisteren** (Listening) | €48 |
| **Schrijven** (Writing) | €48 |
| **Spreken** (Speaking) | €48 |
| **KNM** (Knowledge of Dutch Society) | €51 |
| **ONA** (Orientation on Dutch Labour Market) | €0* |

*ONA doesn't have an exam fee because it's a portfolio-based assessment. You submit proof (like an employment contract) rather than sitting for a test.

**A few things to know about DUO fees:**

- Fees are per attempt. If you fail and retake, you pay the full fee again.
- Payment happens online when you book the exam slot — no paying at the test center.
- DUO accepts iDEAL (the standard Dutch online payment method). Credit cards are generally not accepted through their portal.
- You need a DigiD to register and book exams. If you don't have one yet, apply at your municipality — it takes about a week to arrive by post.

## Retake Costs: What Happens If You Fail

Nobody plans to fail, but it's worth knowing what a retake costs — both financially and in terms of time.

**The retake fee is the same as the first attempt.** There's no penalty surcharge, no escalating costs. Fail the Lezen exam? Rebook it for another €48. The pricing doesn't change whether it's your first attempt or your fifth.

| Scenario | Total Exam Cost |
|---|---|
| Pass all 5 exams on first try | €293 |
| Fail 1 component, retake once | €341-€344 |
| Fail 2 components, retake once each | €389-€395 |
| Fail 1 component, retake twice | €389-€395 |

**How common are retakes?** Most well-prepared candidates pass on the first try. The components with the highest retake rates tend to be **Schrijven** (Writing) and **Spreken** (Speaking), because they require active production rather than recognition. If you're going to allocate extra study time anywhere, put it toward those two.

**Retake waiting period:** After a failed attempt, you typically need to wait at least **2 weeks** before you can book the same component again. This is partly administrative and partly to give you time to prepare. Don't book a retake for the next available slot without studying — you'll likely get the same result.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Take a <a href="/try">free practice exam</a> before booking your real exam. If you're consistently scoring above 70% in practice, you're ready. Below 60%? Give yourself more study time and save the exam fee.</div>

## Hidden Costs Most People Don't Budget For

The DUO fees are only part of the picture. Here are the costs that don't show up on the official price list.

### Travel to Exam Centers

DUO exams are held at specific locations across the Netherlands. Depending on where you live, this might mean a train ride. The main exam centers are in cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Den Haag, Utrecht, Eindhoven, and Zwolle — but not every location offers every exam on every date.

**Estimated travel costs:** €10-€40 per exam trip, depending on distance. If you live in a major city near an exam center, this could be zero. If you're in a smaller town, budget for 5-6 separate trips (one per component, assuming you don't schedule multiple on the same day).

### Study Materials

How much you spend on study materials depends entirely on your approach:

| Study Approach | Estimated Cost |
|---|---|
| **Self-study with free resources** | €0 |
| **Online practice platform** (like PassInBurgering) | €0-€50 |
| **Textbooks** (De Delftse Methode, Code Plus, etc.) | €30-€60 per book |
| **Private language school course** | €500-€2,000+ |
| **Private tutor** (1-on-1 lessons) | €25-€50/hour |

The range is enormous. A disciplined self-studier with access to good free and low-cost resources can prepare for under €100. Someone who enrolls in an intensive language course might spend €2,000+.

Our recommendation: start with free practice exams to assess your level, then decide how much structured learning you actually need. Many kennismigranten who've been living in the Netherlands for a few years already have enough passive Dutch to pass with focused self-study and targeted practice.

### Passport Photos

You'll need biometric passport photos for your IND application (not for the DUO exams themselves). A set of photos costs **€10-€15** at a photo booth or photographer. Minor cost, but it's on the list.

### IND Application Fee

Once you have your inburgeringsdiploma and want to apply for permanent residence, the IND charges **€210** for the application. This is not an inburgering cost per se, but it's part of the same journey and should be in your budget.

## Total Cost Estimates: Three Scenarios

Let's put it all together with three realistic scenarios.

### Scenario 1: The Budget-Conscious Self-Studier

You live in a city with an exam center, study with free resources and an affordable practice platform, and pass everything on the first try.

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| DUO exam fees (5 paid components) | €293 |
| Study materials (online practice) | €0-€50 |
| Travel | €0 |
| Total inburgering cost | **€293-€343** |
| + IND PR application | €210 |
| **Grand total to PR** | **€503-€553** |

### Scenario 2: The Typical Preparer

You need to travel to exam centers, buy a textbook, use an online practice platform, and retake one component.

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| DUO exam fees (first attempts) | €293 |
| One retake | €48 |
| Textbook | €45 |
| Online practice | €30 |
| Travel (6 trips) | €120 |
| Passport photos | €12 |
| Total inburgering cost | **€548** |
| + IND PR application | €210 |
| **Grand total to PR** | **€758** |

### Scenario 3: The Full-Support Route

You take a language school course, use multiple study resources, need two retakes, and travel from a smaller city.

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| DUO exam fees (first attempts) | €293 |
| Two retakes | €96 |
| Language course | €1,200 |
| Online practice + textbooks | €80 |
| Travel (8 trips) | €240 |
| Passport photos | €12 |
| Total inburgering cost | **€1,921** |
| + IND PR application | €210 |
| **Grand total to PR** | **€2,131** |

## How to Save Money on Inburgering

### 1. Study Smart, Not Expensive

The biggest variable cost is study materials and courses. You do not need an expensive language school to pass A2-level exams. Structured self-study with [practice exams](/try) and a [solid study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) is enough for most people who already have some Dutch exposure.

### 2. Pass on the First Try

Every retake costs you €48-€51 plus another trip to the exam center. The cheapest retake is the one you don't need. Invest time in practice before booking your exam — it's cheaper than repeating it.

### 3. Schedule Strategically

If you can schedule multiple exams on the same day or on consecutive days at the same location, you save on travel costs. Check DUO's scheduling system for availability — sometimes you can book Lezen and Luisteren back-to-back.

### 4. Check Employer Reimbursement

Some Dutch employers — particularly large multinationals and companies that hire a lot of internationals — offer reimbursement for inburgering-related costs. This might cover exam fees, study materials, or even language course tuition.

This isn't universal, and many employers aren't even aware they could offer it. But it's worth asking your HR department. Frame it as a professional development expense — you're learning the local language, which benefits the company too.

### 5. DUO Loan (For Mandatory Inburgeraars)

If you have a **mandatory** inburgering obligation (common for partners of kennismigranten and family reunification visa holders), you may qualify for a **DUO loan** that covers:

- Exam fees
- Language course tuition
- Study materials

The loan is **interest-free** and has an important incentive: **if you pass all exams within your deadline, the loan may be partially or fully forgiven.** This means the government essentially pays for your inburgering if you complete it on time.

**Who qualifies:** People with a mandatory inburgering obligation under Wi2021 are automatically offered a loan. Those under Wi2013 with a mandatory obligation can also apply. Voluntary inburgeraars (like kennismigranten choosing to do it for PR) are generally **not** eligible for the DUO loan.

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Watch out:</strong> The DUO loan forgiveness only applies if you pass within your deadline. Miss the deadline, and you'll need to repay the full loan amount. Know your deadline, plan your study schedule, and don't procrastinate.</div>

## When to Pay: Timing Your Expenses

You don't need to pay everything at once. The costs are spread over your study and exam period, which typically spans several months.

**Month 1-2:** Study materials and practice platform costs (€0-€100 for most self-studiers)

**Month 2-4:** Exam fees as you book each component. You pay when you book, not when you sit the exam. Booking usually opens 4-6 weeks before available exam dates.

**Month 4-6:** Any retake fees, if needed. Budget a buffer here.

**After passing all exams:** IND application fee (€210) when you're ready to apply for PR.

This spacing means you're looking at roughly €50-€100 per month over a 4-6 month period for the self-study route, rather than one large upfront payment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are inburgering exam fees tax-deductible?

In some cases, yes. Study costs related to maintaining or improving your position in the Dutch labor market may be deductible. Language learning for professional purposes can qualify. Consult a tax advisor (or your employer's HR department) for your specific situation, as the rules around study cost deductions have changed in recent years.

### What if I can't afford the exam fees?

If you have a mandatory inburgering obligation, the DUO loan is your best option — it's interest-free and potentially forgiven. For voluntary inburgeraars, you might consider spacing out your exams over several months to spread the cost, or checking if your employer offers reimbursement.

### Do exam fees ever change?

DUO adjusts fees periodically, usually with small increases. The fees listed in this article are accurate as of early 2026. Check the [DUO/inburgeren.nl website](https://inburgeren.nl) for the most current pricing before booking.

### Is there a refund if I cancel an exam booking?

You can cancel or reschedule a DUO exam booking up to a certain deadline before the exam date (typically a few days). After that deadline, you lose the fee. Check DUO's cancellation policy when you book — it's stated in the confirmation email.

### Are practice exams free?

Official DUO practice materials are limited. Third-party practice platforms like [PassInBurgering](/try) offer free practice exams that mirror the real exam format. Practicing with realistic exam questions is one of the best ways to avoid paying for retakes.

## The Bottom Line

The inburgering exams are one of the most affordable parts of the entire immigration process in the Netherlands. At under €300 for all six components, the exam fees themselves aren't the financial barrier — it's the study approach and preparation time that drive most of the cost variation.

For most people, a realistic all-in budget of **€500-€800** covers everything from study materials through the IND application fee. That's the price of a long weekend in Paris — except this investment gets you permanent residence in the Netherlands.
