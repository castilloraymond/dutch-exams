# What the Inburgering Exam Actually Looks Like: A Complete Walkthrough

The number one thing that makes the inburgering exam harder than it needs to be? Not knowing what you're walking into.

People spend weeks studying vocabulary and KNM facts, then show up at the exam center flustered because they didn't know where to park, what to bring, or that the computer interface works a certain way. That uncertainty eats into focus. And focus is everything when you're answering questions in your second (or third, or fourth) language.

This guide walks you through the entire exam experience — from the moment you book your slot on the DUO website to the moment you get your results. Every step, every component, every detail that nobody bothers to tell you ahead of time.

If you've already been studying and just want to know what exam day feels like, you're in the right place. If you haven't started studying yet, read this first, then check out [the 30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) to build your preparation around what you'll learn here.

## How to Book Your Exams at DUO

All inburgering exams are administered by **DUO** (Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs) — the same government agency that handles student finance in the Netherlands. You book through their online portal at [inburgeren.nl](https://inburgeren.nl).

Here's what you need before you can book:

- **DigiD** — your Dutch digital identity login. If you don't have one, apply at your municipality. It arrives by post in about a week.
- **BSN** (Burgerservicenummer) — your citizen service number. You received this when you registered at your gemeente.
- **iDEAL payment** — DUO accepts iDEAL (standard Dutch online banking). Credit cards generally don't work through their portal.

The booking process itself is straightforward:

1. Log in to the Mijn Inburgering portal with your DigiD
2. Select the exam component you want to book
3. Choose an available date and location
4. Pay the fee via iDEAL
5. Receive a confirmation email with your exam details

**You book each component separately.** Lezen, Luisteren, Schrijven, Spreken, and KNM are five independent exams. You can take them in any order, on different days, at different locations. Some people knock out two or three in a single day. Others spread them across several weeks.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Book your exams at least 3-4 weeks in advance. Popular locations (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Den Haag) fill up fast, especially on weekends. Smaller cities often have more availability. Check multiple locations if your preferred date is taken.</div>

**Exam center locations** are spread across the Netherlands. Major cities — Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Den Haag, Utrecht, Eindhoven, Zwolle, Groningen — all have centers. But not every center offers every component on every date. The portal shows you what's available.

One thing people don't realize: **you can schedule multiple exams on the same day** if the timeslots work out. Taking Lezen in the morning and KNM in the afternoon is perfectly fine. Just leave enough buffer time between sessions, especially if they're at the same location. You don't want to rush from one exam straight into another.

For a complete breakdown of what each component costs, see our [exam costs guide](/blog/inburgering-exam-costs-2026).

## What to Bring on Exam Day

Pack light, but don't forget the essentials. The exam center is strict about what you can and can't bring into the testing room.

**Required — you cannot take the exam without these:**
- **Valid ID** — passport or Dutch ID card (rijbewijs is NOT accepted). This is non-negotiable. No ID, no exam, no refund.
- **Your booking confirmation** — the email from DUO with your exam details. Having it on your phone is usually fine, but printing a copy is safer.

**Leave at home or in the locker:**
- Your phone (must be turned off and stored before entering the exam room)
- Smart watches, earbuds, or any electronic devices
- Notes, books, or study materials
- Food and drinks (water bottles are sometimes allowed — check with your specific center)
- Bags and coats go in a locker or designated area

**Optionally useful:**
- Earplugs (some centers provide them, but bringing your own ensures you have them)
- A light snack for between exams if you're doing multiple components
- Cash or a debit card for vending machines during breaks

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Watch out:</strong> Your rijbewijs (Dutch driving license) is NOT a valid ID for the exam. You need a passport or Dutch identity card. People get turned away for this — don't let it happen to you.</div>

## Arriving and Checking In

Plan to arrive **at least 15 minutes before your scheduled exam time.** Here's what happens when you get there.

**Finding the exam center.** DUO exam locations are usually in office buildings or educational facilities. They're not always well-signed from the street. Check the exact address on Google Maps the day before, and look for parking or public transport options. If you're cycling, there's almost always bike parking nearby — this is the Netherlands, after all.

**Check-in process:**

1. **Reception desk.** You'll check in at a reception area. Show your ID (passport or Dutch ID card) and your booking confirmation.
2. **ID verification.** Staff will verify your identity against the booking. They check your photo carefully — this isn't a formality.
3. **Locker assignment.** You'll be given a locker or directed to a storage area for your phone, bag, and any other personal items.
4. **Waiting area.** After check-in, you wait in a designated area until your exam session is called. This might be a few minutes or up to 15 minutes.
5. **Escorted to exam room.** An invigilator walks the group to the testing room. You don't wander the building looking for it.

The atmosphere is calm but formal. The staff are used to nervous candidates. They'll explain the basics before you sit down, but they can't answer questions about exam content.

## The Testing Room Setup

The exam room looks like a computer lab. Rows of desks, each with a computer monitor, keyboard, mouse, and headphones. Individual partitions separate each workstation so you can't see your neighbor's screen.

Here's what to expect:

- **Computers are pre-loaded** with the exam software. You don't log in yourself — the invigilator starts your session.
- **Headphones are provided.** You'll use them for the Luisteren (listening) exam and for audio instructions in other components. Even for non-listening exams, the headphones help block ambient noise.
- **The interface is simple.** Questions appear one at a time. You click your answer from multiple-choice options, then click "next" to move forward. A progress bar shows how far along you are.
- **You can go back.** On most components, you can navigate back to previous questions and change your answers before submitting. Use this — it's a safety net for when you second-guess an answer.
- **A clock is visible** on screen showing your remaining time.

Other candidates may be taking different exam components simultaneously. One person might be doing Lezen while the person next to them does KNM. Everyone has headphones, so the room stays quiet.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">5</div><div class="stat-label">Separate exam components — each booked, taken, and scored independently</div></div>

## Component 1: Lezen (Reading)

**Duration:** 65 minutes | **Questions:** ~25 | **Format:** Multiple choice | **Cost:** €48

The Lezen exam is where most people start, and it's often considered the most approachable component. You read short Dutch texts on screen and answer multiple-choice questions about them.

**What the texts look like:**

You'll see everyday Dutch texts — the kind of thing you'd find in your mailbox, on a notice board, or in an email. Short advertisements, letters from your municipality, emails from a school, information about a product or service, notices about building maintenance, bus schedules, and simple forms.

Each text is followed by 1-3 questions. Some ask about the main idea ("What is this text about?"), others ask for specific details ("What time does the event start?"), and some test inference ("Why did the writer send this email?").

**What it feels like:**

You read a text on the left side of the screen. Questions appear on the right or below. Each question has 3-4 answer options. You pick one, move to the next. The interface is clean and not cluttered.

65 minutes for 25 questions is generous. That's roughly 2.5 minutes per question, including reading time. Most prepared candidates finish with 15-20 minutes to spare. If you're rushing, you're probably overthinking.

**Common traps:**
- **Distractor answers** that use words from the text but answer a different question
- **"All of the above"** or **"none of the above"** options that require careful reading
- Questions about the **purpose** of a text, not just its content

For a detailed breakdown of the reading exam format and strategies, see our [Lezen exam guide](/blog/lezen-reading-exam-format-scoring).

## Component 2: Luisteren (Listening)

**Duration:** ~30 minutes | **Questions:** ~25 | **Format:** Multiple choice | **Cost:** €48

The Luisteren exam tests whether you can understand spoken Dutch at a natural pace. You listen to short audio clips through your headphones and answer multiple-choice questions.

**What the audio sounds like:**

Short conversations and monologues — a phone call to a doctor's office, a weather report, an announcement at a train station, a conversation between colleagues, a voicemail from a friend. Speakers talk at a normal conversational pace. They don't slow down for you, but the audio is clear and professional — no background noise or mumbling.

**How it works:**

1. You see a question on screen (sometimes with an image or context clue)
2. An audio clip plays through your headphones
3. **You can listen to each clip twice** — this is crucial. Use the second listen to confirm your answer.
4. You select your answer from 3-4 options
5. Move to the next question

**What catches people off guard:**

- The **speed**. If you've mostly been exposed to Dutch through language apps (where speakers talk slowly and clearly), real-speed Dutch audio can feel fast. Watch NOS Journaal or listen to Dutch podcasts to calibrate your ear before the exam.
- **Colloquial speech.** Some clips use informal Dutch — contractions, filler words, the kind of Dutch people actually speak versus textbook Dutch.
- **You can't pause the audio** mid-clip. It plays, you listen, it stops. Then you can replay it once. That's it.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> On the first listen, focus on the overall meaning. On the second listen, hunt for the specific detail the question asks about. Trying to catch every word on the first pass is a trap — focus on comprehension, not translation.</div>

## Component 3: Schrijven (Writing)

**Duration:** ~35 minutes | **Tasks:** ~4 | **Format:** Typed responses | **Cost:** €48

The Schrijven exam is where things shift from recognition to production. You're no longer picking from options — you're writing Dutch text yourself. This is one of the two components with the highest failure rates, not because it's the hardest, but because people underprepare for active production.

**What you'll write:**

Short, practical texts that mirror real-life writing tasks:

- **Filling out a form** — a registration form, a complaint form, a request form. You type information into specific fields.
- **Writing a short email** — responding to an invitation, requesting information, canceling an appointment. Typically 4-8 sentences.
- **Writing a note or message** — a note to a colleague, a message to a neighbor, a reply to a parent group chat about school.

**How the interface works:**

The screen shows a scenario and a blank text field. The scenario explains who you're writing to and why. For example: "Your child is sick and can't go to school. Write an email to the teacher." You type your response directly into the text field.

For form-filling tasks, the screen shows a form layout with blank fields. You type the appropriate information in each field.

**What gets graded:**

- **Task completion** — did you address what the scenario asked?
- **Vocabulary and grammar** — at A2 level. They're not expecting perfect Dutch. Simple, correct sentences score well.
- **Appropriateness** — did you use the right register? An email to your child's teacher should be polite (u instead of je). A note to a friend can be informal.

**The biggest mistake people make:**

Trying to write complex sentences and making grammar errors. A short, simple email with correct grammar scores better than a long, ambitious email full of mistakes. "Mijn kind is ziek. Hij kan morgen niet naar school komen." is perfectly fine. You don't need subordinate clauses or impressive vocabulary.

## Component 4: Spreken (Speaking)

**Duration:** ~15 minutes | **Tasks:** ~4 | **Format:** Recorded responses | **Cost:** €48

The Spreken exam is the shortest component but often the most stressful. You speak into a microphone, and your responses are recorded for later evaluation by examiners.

**How it works:**

You sit at the same computer workstation, but now you're wearing a headset with a microphone. The exam has several parts:

1. **Repeating sentences.** You hear a Dutch sentence through your headphones and repeat it. This tests pronunciation and fluency. The sentences get progressively longer.
2. **Answering short questions.** You hear a question ("What is your favorite season?") and give a brief spoken answer. 2-3 sentences is enough.
3. **Describing a situation.** You see an image or scenario on screen and describe what's happening or respond to a prompt. "You see your neighbor carrying heavy groceries. What do you say?"
4. **Extended response.** You get a topic and speak about it for 30-60 seconds. "Tell me about your daily routine" or "What do you like about the Netherlands?"

**What it feels like:**

Awkward. You're talking to a computer screen in a room full of other people who are also talking to their computer screens (or taking silent exams). Everyone has headphones on, so the room has a strange murmur to it. You can hear yourself through your headset, which helps you monitor your volume and clarity.

There's a time indicator on screen. For each task, you see how long you have to respond. When the time is up, the recording stops and you move to the next task. You can't go back and re-record.

**What examiners look for:**

- **Intelligibility** — can they understand you? Accent is fine. Clarity matters.
- **Fluency** — can you speak without long pauses or constant restarts?
- **Vocabulary range** — can you use appropriate words for everyday topics?
- **Grammar** — at A2 level. Simple present tense, basic word order, common verbs. They're not expecting perfect de/het usage.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> The Spreken exam rewards confidence over perfection. A fluent answer with minor grammar mistakes scores better than a technically correct answer delivered with long pauses and hesitation. Practice speaking out loud — to yourself, to a language partner, to your cat. Just get comfortable producing Dutch verbally.</div>

## Component 5: KNM (Knowledge of Dutch Society)

**Duration:** 45 minutes | **Questions:** 40 | **Format:** Multiple choice | **Cost:** €51 | **Pass mark:** 28/40 (70%)

The KNM exam tests your knowledge of how the Netherlands works — its systems, history, laws, values, and everyday customs. This is the only component that's not a language test. The questions are in Dutch, but they test factual knowledge, not language ability.

**What topics appear:**

The exam covers 8 themes across 4 life areas:

- **Work & Income** — employment contracts, employee rights, UWV, taxes, minimum wage
- **Health & Healthcare** — the huisarts system, zorgverzekering, eigen risico, when to call 112
- **Values & Norms** — constitutional rights, equality, anti-discrimination, LGBTQ+ rights, the Holocaust
- **Housing** — tenant rights, registration at gemeente, housing associations
- **Geography & History** — provinces, major cities, waterways, colonial history, the Golden Age
- **Government & Politics** — how elections work, the monarchy, the role of the Tweede Kamer
- **Education** — school system structure, leerplicht (compulsory education), higher education
- **Daily Life** — DigiD, OV-chipkaart, recycling rules, insurance

**What the questions look like:**

Straightforward factual questions. "What is the eigen risico?" "Which city is the seat of government in the Netherlands?" "What should you do if you disagree with a decision from the gemeente?" Three or four answer options per question.

**The challenge:**

You might live in the Netherlands and think you know how things work. But the KNM tests specific knowledge that daily life doesn't always teach you. Do you know the difference between the Eerste Kamer and the Tweede Kamer? Do you know what Keti Koti commemorates? Do you know your rights if your landlord wants to raise the rent?

The KNM pass mark is **70%** — higher than the language components. You need at least 28 out of 40 correct. That means you can only afford to get 12 questions wrong. Study the topics you don't encounter in daily life, especially history, government, and values.

For more on the new KNM format, see our [KNM exam changes guide](/blog/knm-exam-2026-new-format). And if you want a deeper dive into the healthcare section specifically, check out our [Dutch healthcare KNM guide](/blog/dutch-healthcare-expats-knm-guide).

## Breaks Between Components

If you're taking multiple exam components on the same day, you'll have time between sessions. The exact break length depends on the schedule, but here's how it typically works:

- **Between separately booked exams:** You leave the exam room after finishing one component, return to the waiting area, and check in again for the next one. Breaks can range from 30 minutes to several hours depending on how you booked.
- **During a single exam session:** There are no official breaks within an individual component. You have 65 minutes for Lezen, 45 minutes for KNM, etc. — that's continuous.
- **Restroom breaks:** You can raise your hand during an exam to request a restroom break. The clock does NOT stop. Use the restroom before the exam starts.

**If you're scheduling two exams the same day,** book them at least 1.5 hours apart. You need time to check out, decompress, maybe eat something, and check in again. Don't schedule back-to-back with only 30 minutes between — the mental switch between components needs buffer time.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Bring a snack and water for the gap between exams. Most exam centers have vending machines but not always a cafeteria. A banana and a bottle of water go a long way when you're mentally drained between sessions.</div>

## Getting Your Results

After all that preparation and exam-day stress, you want one thing: your score. Here's how results work.

**When you'll get results:**

- Results are typically available within **8 weeks** after your exam date.
- You check your results through the **Mijn Inburgering portal** at inburgeren.nl — the same place where you booked.
- DUO does not call you, email you the score, or send it by post. You have to log in and check.

**How results are displayed:**

For each component, you'll see one of two outcomes:

- **Geslaagd** (Passed) — you met the required threshold
- **Niet geslaagd** (Not passed) — you didn't meet the threshold

You'll also see your score relative to the pass mark. The exact scoring methodology varies by component, but the overall pass rate for each is roughly:

| Component | Approximate Pass Threshold |
|---|---|
| Lezen | ~60% correct |
| Luisteren | ~60% correct |
| Schrijven | Meets A2 criteria (rubric-based) |
| Spreken | Meets A2 criteria (rubric-based) |
| KNM | 28/40 (70%) |

**Writing and Speaking** are graded by human examiners using rubrics, not simple percentage scores. This is why their results sometimes take longer to appear.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">8 weeks</div><div class="stat-label">Maximum wait time for exam results through the Mijn Inburgering portal</div></div>

**Once you pass all components,** DUO issues your **inburgeringsdiploma.** This is the document you need for your IND application for permanent residence or Dutch citizenship. The diploma is uploaded to your Mijn Inburgering account as a PDF. Guard it carefully — you'll need it.

## What Happens If You Fail

Failing one or more components isn't the end of the world. It happens, and the system is designed for retakes.

**Retake policy:**

- You can retake any failed component **as many times as you need.**
- There's a **minimum 2-week waiting period** between attempts of the same component.
- The retake fee is the **same as the first attempt** — no penalty charges. Lezen is €48 whether it's your first try or your fifth.
- Your passing scores on other components **remain valid.** If you passed Lezen, Luisteren, and KNM but failed Schrijven, you only need to retake Schrijven.

**The deadline factor:**

Most inburgering candidates have a **deadline** (termijn) by which they must have passed all components. This deadline was set when you received your inburgering requirement, typically 3 years from the date of your residence permit. Missing the deadline can result in fines or impact your residence status.

If you're running low on time:
- Book your retake as soon as the 2-week waiting period allows
- Focus your study exclusively on the failed component
- Consider taking a [practice exam](/learn) to identify exactly where you went wrong before rebooking

**Common reasons people fail and how to fix them:**

| Reason | Fix |
|---|---|
| Ran out of time | Practice under timed conditions |
| Misread questions | Read the question BEFORE the text, then read for the answer |
| KNM knowledge gaps | Study the specific topics you missed, not everything again |
| Schrijven grammar errors | Write simpler sentences — short and correct beats long and wrong |
| Spreken hesitation | Practice speaking out loud daily, even 5 minutes |

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Watch out:</strong> Don't rebook a retake for the earliest possible date without studying the areas where you failed. Repeating the same preparation and expecting different results is how people end up taking the same component three or four times.</div>

## Putting It All Together: Your Exam Day Timeline

Here's what a typical exam day looks like, start to finish, for someone taking the Lezen exam at 10:00 AM:

| Time | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **9:00** | Leave home with passport, booking confirmation, and earplugs |
| **9:30** | Arrive at exam center, find the entrance |
| **9:35** | Check in at reception, show ID, store phone in locker |
| **9:45** | Wait in the waiting area with other candidates |
| **9:55** | Invigilator escorts group to exam room |
| **10:00** | Exam begins — headphones on, interface explained, timer starts |
| **10:45** | Finished with 20 minutes to spare — review flagged questions |
| **11:05** | Time's up (or you submit early) — leave the exam room |
| **11:10** | Collect belongings from locker, check out |
| **11:15** | Done. Results in up to 8 weeks. |

If you're taking a second component in the afternoon, grab lunch, take a walk, and check in again 15 minutes before your next session. The routine is the same.

## Final Preparation Checklist

Before your exam date, make sure you can check off everything on this list:

- [ ] **Booked your exam** through Mijn Inburgering portal
- [ ] **Valid passport or Dutch ID card** (not rijbewijs)
- [ ] **Booking confirmation** saved to phone and/or printed
- [ ] **Route to exam center** checked on Google Maps
- [ ] **Practiced under timed conditions** — not just studied, but taken full practice exams
- [ ] **Scored above 70% consistently** on practice exams for the component you're taking
- [ ] **Slept well** the night before (seriously — fatigue kills exam performance)
- [ ] **Packed:** ID, confirmation, earplugs, snack, water, debit card

The inburgering exam isn't designed to trick you. It's designed to verify that you can function in Dutch at a basic level. If you've prepared properly, exam day is just a formality — a long, slightly tedious formality in a quiet room with headphones.

Want to make sure you're ready? [Take a free practice exam](/learn) and see where you stand. If you need a structured preparation approach, the [30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) breaks everything into manageable daily chunks.

You've got this.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I take all 5 exam components on the same day?

Technically, yes — if the scheduling works out. But it's not recommended. Five exams in one day is mentally exhausting, and fatigue degrades your performance on later components. Most people take 1-2 components per day, spread across 2-3 exam dates.

### What language are the exam instructions in?

The instructions and interface are in Dutch. For the KNM exam, both the questions and answers are in Dutch. There's no English translation option. This is why even the KNM (which tests knowledge, not language) requires basic Dutch reading ability.

### Can I reschedule or cancel a booked exam?

Yes, but there are deadlines. You can reschedule or cancel through the Mijn Inburgering portal, typically up to **4 days before** the exam date. After that deadline, you forfeit the fee. Check the specific cancellation policy when you book, as it can change.

### What if I arrive late?

If you arrive after the exam has started, you will likely **not be admitted.** DUO is strict about start times. Arriving even 5 minutes late can mean losing your slot and your exam fee. Aim to arrive 15-20 minutes early.

### Is the exam the same every time, or does it change?

The questions change between exam sessions. You won't see the exact same exam if you retake a component. The format, difficulty level, and question types stay consistent, but the specific texts, audio clips, and questions rotate. This means memorizing answers from practice exams won't help — you need to build genuine comprehension skills.
