# 7 Inburgering Mistakes That Cost Expats Months of Extra Prep

Every week, people show up to the DUO exam center thinking they're ready. They studied Dutch for months. They feel confident. Then they fail a component they didn't expect to fail, pay another round of exam fees, and lose weeks waiting for a retake slot.

The frustrating part? Almost all of these failures are preventable. They come from the same handful of mistakes that expats make over and over again — mistakes that have nothing to do with intelligence or effort and everything to do with misunderstanding what the inburgering exam actually tests.

Here are the seven biggest ones. Each comes with a concrete fix you can act on today.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">7</div><div class="stat-label">Common mistakes that cost expats an average of 2-4 extra months of preparation time</div></div>

## Mistake #1: Studying Dutch Instead of Studying for the Exam

This is the big one. The mistake that wastes more time than all the others combined.

Here's what happens: someone decides to do inburgering, so they sign up for a Dutch course or open Duolingo and start grinding vocabulary and grammar. Six months later, their Dutch is better — maybe even decent — but they've never actually seen what a DUO exam looks like.

Then they take a practice exam and realize: the Lezen exam isn't just "reading Dutch." It's reading specific types of texts (ads, emails, notices, short articles) and answering multiple-choice questions about them within a time limit. The Schrijven exam isn't just "writing Dutch." It's writing specific text types (a short email, a form response, a message to a landlord) following specific formats.

**The exam tests exam skills, not just language skills.** A person who speaks B1 Dutch but has never practiced the exam formats can score lower than someone at A2 who has drilled the formats religiously.

**The fix:** Start with practice exams, not language courses. Take a [free practice exam](/try) in every component during your first week. Even if you're not ready, you need to see the formats. Then structure your study around those formats. Language improvement happens naturally when you practice with real exam materials.

## Mistake #2: Ignoring the KNM Until the Last Week

"I live in the Netherlands. I know how things work here. I'll just study KNM the night before."

This is the sentence that precedes about 40% of KNM failures.

The KNM (Kennis van de Nederlandse Maatschappij) exam was completely redesigned in July 2025. It's now **40 factual multiple-choice questions** covering 8 specific topics: healthcare, employment, housing, values and norms, geography, history, political systems, and digital skills. The pass mark is **70%** — stricter than any of the language exams.

Living in the Netherlands doesn't prepare you for this. Knowing how to visit your huisarts doesn't mean you know what a POH (praktijkondersteuner huisarts) does. Renting an apartment doesn't mean you know your tenant rights under Dutch law. Using DigiD doesn't mean you can answer questions about digital safety protocols.

The KNM requires **15-25 hours** of dedicated study. That's 2-3 weeks of consistent review, not one panicked evening.

**The fix:** Start KNM study in your first week of preparation, not your last. Spend 30-45 minutes per day reviewing one topic area at a time. Use [KNM practice exams](/learn/knm/exam) to test yourself regularly. Read our [KNM format breakdown](/blog/knm-exam-2026-new-format) so you know exactly what's tested.

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Watch out:</strong> If your KNM study materials don't mention the Holocaust, Keti Koti, Eid al-Fitr, POH, or digital safety, they were made for the old exam format (pre-July 2025). Using outdated materials is one of the most common reasons people fail KNM.</div>

## Mistake #3: Not Practicing Under Timed Conditions

You can answer every question correctly when you have unlimited time. You can read that passage twice, check your dictionary, think carefully about each option. But the real exam gives you a fixed number of minutes, and the clock changes everything.

Time pressure makes you second-guess yourself. It makes you misread questions. It makes you skip the passage details that actually contain the answer because you're rushing. The Lezen exam gives you about 35 minutes. The KNM gives you 45 minutes for 40 questions — just over a minute per question.

Most people discover this problem on exam day, which is the worst possible time to discover it.

**The fix:** From week two onward, always practice with a timer. Set your phone alarm. Don't pause. Don't look things up. Get comfortable with the stress of the clock before you're sitting in the exam center. If you're consistently running out of time, that tells you something specific: you need to practice reading speed, not vocabulary.

Use the [practice exam mode](/learn/lezen/exam) on our platform — it simulates real timed conditions so there are no surprises on exam day.

## Mistake #4: Spending Thousands on Courses When Self-Study Works

Let's talk about the inburgering course industry. Language schools charge **EUR 2,000-5,000** for inburgering preparation courses that typically run 3-6 months. Some are good. Many are mediocre. Almost all of them are slower than self-study for a motivated professional.

Why? Because courses move at the pace of the class. If your reading is strong but your writing is weak, too bad — you're sitting through reading lessons you don't need. If you can already pass KNM but struggle with Spreken, the course doesn't care — the schedule is the schedule.

The inburgering exam is at **A2 level**. This is not B2. This is not C1. A2 is basic survival-level Dutch. For a motivated adult with access to good practice materials, self-study is not just adequate — it's often faster and vastly cheaper.

**The fix:** Before spending money on a course, take a diagnostic. If you score above 50% on practice exams, a course will slow you down. Put that money toward exam fees and practice materials instead. If you truly need a course (starting from zero, need external structure), look for an intensive group course rather than a long-format one. Four weeks of intensive is worth more than six months of twice-a-week.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Check the <a href="/blog/inburgering-exam-costs-2026">full cost breakdown</a> before committing to a course. The exams themselves cost under EUR 300 total. Why spend 10x that on preparation when targeted self-study gets you to the same place?</div>

## Mistake #5: Waiting Until Deadline Pressure to Start

The government gives you **three years** to complete inburgering (under Wi2013). That sounds like plenty of time. So you tell yourself you'll start next month. Then next quarter. Then after summer. Then after the holidays.

Suddenly it's two years in and you haven't studied a single hour. Now you've got 12 months left, you're panicking, and you need to schedule exams with limited availability. DUO exam slots book up 4-6 weeks in advance in busy periods. Retake slots add more waiting time. What should have been a calm 2-month project becomes a stressful 6-month scramble.

There's another angle here too. People who wait tend to overthink. They read every blog post, join every Facebook group, ask everyone they know for advice, and build up so much anxiety about the exam that it feels like a much bigger deal than it is. Analysis paralysis turns a manageable task into a monster.

**The fix:** Set a target date within the next 3 months, regardless of where you are in the process. Book your first exam slot for 8-10 weeks from now. Having a real date on the calendar changes everything — it converts vague intention into concrete action. Follow the [30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) and start today. Not Monday. Not next month. Today.

## Mistake #6: Neglecting Speaking Practice Because It's Embarrassing

Everyone's got a story. The time they tried to speak Dutch at the supermarket and the cashier immediately switched to English. The time they mispronounced something at a party and everyone laughed. The time they just... froze.

So people avoid speaking practice. They tell themselves they'll focus on it later, once their grammar is better, once they feel more confident. Later becomes never, and they walk into the Spreken exam having barely practiced out loud.

The Spreken exam asks you to speak about everyday topics — describing your home, explaining a problem to a doctor, leaving a voicemail for your child's school. It's recorded, not face-to-face, which helps with nerves. But if you haven't practiced producing spoken Dutch at any kind of tempo, the exam will feel brutal.

**The fix:** Practice speaking from day one of your preparation. Not in conversation — that comes later. Start by reading Dutch texts out loud. Then progress to describing things in your room. Then answering practice prompts. Record yourself on your phone and listen back. You'll cringe at first. That's normal. By week two, you won't cringe anymore.

Five minutes of speaking practice per day beats one hour per week. Make it a daily habit, not an occasional event.

## Mistake #7: Not Understanding Which Law Applies to You

This mistake doesn't waste study time — it wastes something worse: **it causes people to prepare for the wrong thing entirely.**

There are two inburgering laws in the Netherlands:

- **Wi2013** — applies to most people who arrived or became inburgering-plichtig before January 1, 2022, and to most kennismigranten who integrate voluntarily
- **Wi2021** — applies primarily to people with a mandatory inburgering obligation who got their residence permit on or after January 1, 2022

The difference matters enormously. Wi2013 requires **A2-level** language exams. Wi2021 aims for **B1 level** — one full step higher. B1 requires significantly more vocabulary, more complex grammar, and better fluency. Preparing for A2 when you need B1 means you'll fail. Preparing for B1 when you only need A2 means you're wasting weeks studying to a higher standard than necessary.

Your spouse might fall under a different law than you. A kennismigrant integrating voluntarily almost always falls under Wi2013, but their partner on a dependent visa might be under Wi2021 if they arrived after January 2022.

**The fix:** Confirm which law applies to you before studying a single hour. Check your inburgering letter from DUO, call DUO directly, or verify through the [Mijn Inburgering portal](https://inburgeren.nl). If you're a kennismigrant voluntarily integrating, read our [kennismigrant guide](/blog/inburgering-kennismigranten-30-percent-ruling) for specifics on how the rules apply to you.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Getting this wrong doesn't just waste time — it can mean preparing at entirely the wrong level. Verify your pathway before you start. Five minutes of checking saves months of misdirected effort.</div>

## The Meta-Mistake: Treating Inburgering as a Language Challenge

All seven mistakes above share a common root: **people treat the inburgering exam as a Dutch language test.** It's not. It's a series of specific, predictable, format-driven exams that happen to be in Dutch.

The difference matters. A language test measures how well you speak Dutch in general. The inburgering exam measures whether you can do specific tasks (read an ad and answer questions about it, write a complaint email, describe your work to a recording device, answer 40 factual questions about Dutch society) at a specific level.

When you understand this, everything changes. You stop studying Dutch aimlessly and start preparing for specific exam components. You stop wondering "is my Dutch good enough?" and start asking "can I pass this specific exam format?" That second question has a clear, measurable answer — and the answer is usually "yes, sooner than you think."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the most common component to fail?

**Schrijven (Writing) and Spreken (Speaking)** have the highest retake rates. Both require active production rather than recognition, and both have specific format requirements that catch people off guard. Reading and Listening are passive skills — if you live in the Netherlands, you're already practicing them daily.

### How much money do these mistakes actually cost?

Each failed component costs **EUR 48-51** in retake fees, plus weeks of waiting for a new exam slot. But the bigger cost is time. Spending 4 months preparing when you could have done it in 6 weeks — that's time you don't get back. Check our [cost breakdown](/blog/inburgering-exam-costs-2026) for the full financial picture.

### Can I still pass if I've already made some of these mistakes?

Absolutely. Every one of these mistakes is fixable right now. Take a [practice exam](/try) today to see where you actually stand. Then follow the [30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) to prepare efficiently. Most people who switch from unfocused studying to targeted exam prep see their scores jump within a week.

### Is it worth hiring a tutor?

A tutor makes sense in two situations: you need help with Spreken and have nobody to practice with, or you're failing a specific component and can't figure out why. For general preparation, self-study with good practice materials is faster. A tutor at EUR 30-50/hour for occasional targeted sessions is smart. A tutor for 6 months of general Dutch improvement is overkill for A2.

### What if I'm running out of time on my inburgering deadline?

First, check whether you can request an extension from DUO — extensions are possible in some circumstances. Then prioritize ruthlessly. Take practice exams for all components, identify which ones you can already pass, and book those immediately. Focus all remaining study time on the components where you're weakest. The [exam walkthrough](/blog/inburgering-exam-walkthrough-2026) can help you understand exactly what each component requires so you don't waste time preparing for the wrong thing.

## Start Fixing These Today

You don't need to overhaul your entire preparation strategy. Just pick the one mistake from this list that sounds most familiar and fix that one thing. Maybe it's finally doing a timed practice exam. Maybe it's opening a KNM study guide. Maybe it's spending five minutes speaking Dutch out loud.

The people who pass the inburgering exam on their first try aren't smarter or more talented at languages. They just avoid these seven mistakes. Now you know what they are.
