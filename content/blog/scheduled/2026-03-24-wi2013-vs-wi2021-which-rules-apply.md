# Wi2013 vs Wi2021: Which Inburgering Rules Apply to You?

The Netherlands has **two inburgering laws** running at the same time: Wi2013 (Wet inburgering 2013) and Wi2021 (Wet inburgering 2021). Which one applies to you determines what language level you need, how you study, what exams you take, and how much the whole process costs. Get it wrong and you'll spend months preparing for the wrong exam at the wrong level.

This is hands-down the most confusing part of the inburgering process. So let's cut through it.

## The 30-Second Version

Here's the quick rule:

- **Wi2013** applies if you arrived before January 1, 2022 — or if you're doing inburgering *voluntarily* (like kennismigranten pursuing PR or citizenship)
- **Wi2021** applies if you have a *mandatory* inburgering obligation and received your residence permit on or after January 1, 2022

<div class="takeaway-box">Most kennismigranten and professionals doing inburgering for permanent residence fall under Wi2013 — regardless of when they arrived in the Netherlands. This means A2-level exams, not B1.</div>

That single fact saves you roughly half the study time. But let's get into the details so you can be sure.

## Decision Tree: Which Law Applies to You?

Work through this table from top to bottom. Stop at the first row that matches your situation.

| # | Your Situation | Law | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | EU/EEA/Swiss national | **Exempt** — no inburgering required | N/A |
| 2 | Kennismigrant or 30% ruling holder, doing inburgering voluntarily for PR or citizenship | **Wi2013** | **A2** |
| 3 | Arrived before Jan 1, 2022 with mandatory inburgering obligation | **Wi2013** | **A2** |
| 4 | Arrived on or after Jan 1, 2022 with mandatory inburgering obligation | **Wi2021** | **B1** (A2 fallback possible) |
| 5 | Spouse/partner of kennismigrant, arrived before Jan 1, 2022 | **Wi2013** | **A2** |
| 6 | Spouse/partner of kennismigrant, arrived on or after Jan 1, 2022, mandatory obligation | **Wi2021** | **B1** (A2 fallback possible) |
| 7 | Turkish national (under Association Agreement) | **Special rules** — contact DUO | Varies |

<div class="warning-box">If you're a kennismigrant doing inburgering voluntarily, you fall under Wi2013 even if you moved to the Netherlands in 2024 or 2025. The date you arrived is irrelevant — what matters is whether your inburgering is mandatory or voluntary. This catches people off guard constantly.</div>

Row 4 is where most confusion lives. "Mandatory inburgering obligation" means DUO sent you a letter (or will send one) telling you that you *must* integrate. If you never received that letter and you're choosing to do inburgering to qualify for PR, you're voluntary — which means Wi2013.

## Wi2013 vs Wi2021: The Full Comparison

Here's everything that's different between the two frameworks.

### Language Level

This is the big one.

| | Wi2013 | Wi2021 |
|---|---|---|
| **Target level** | **A2** | **B1** |
| **Vocabulary needed** | ~1,000-2,000 words | ~3,000+ words |
| **What A2/B1 means** | Simple conversations, short texts, basic daily situations | Extended discussions, longer articles, expressing and defending opinions |
| **Fallback level** | N/A — A2 is the standard | A2 (if you can prove B1 is unachievable after extensive effort) |

The difference between A2 and B1 isn't small. It's roughly **double the vocabulary** and significantly more complex grammar. A2 means you can handle straightforward everyday situations. B1 means you can discuss abstract topics, understand main points of standard speech, and write connected text.

For a busy professional, that's the difference between a few months of focused prep and potentially a year or more of study. Read more about [what A2 actually looks like in practice](/blog/a2-dutch-level-explained-inburgering).

<div class="stat-box"><span class="stat-number">A2 vs B1</span><span class="stat-label">Wi2013 requires A2 (basic). Wi2021 targets B1 (intermediate) — roughly double the effort.</span></div>

### How You Study

This is where the two laws feel completely different in practice.

**Wi2013: Self-directed.** You choose how to prepare. Buy a textbook, take a private course, use an app, study with a friend — it's entirely up to you. You register for exams when you feel ready and take them at a DUO exam location. There's no learning plan, no mandatory check-ins, no assigned route.

**Wi2021: Municipality-assigned learning route.** Your local municipality (gemeente) assesses your situation and assigns you one of three learning routes:

| Route | Who It's For | What It Involves |
|---|---|---|
| **B1 Route** | Most people | Formal language classes + civic integration at an approved school, target B1 |
| **Onderwijsroute** (Education route) | Young adults aiming for Dutch education | Intensive language training to enter Dutch higher education |
| **Z-route** (Self-reliance route) | People unlikely to reach B1 | Focus on self-reliance and participation, lower language bar |

Under Wi2021, you don't just pick a school and go. The municipality arranges it. You get a **PIP** (Personal Integration and Participation Plan), regular progress reviews, and consequences if you fall behind.

For kennismigranten under Wi2013, the self-directed approach is actually an advantage. You control the pace, the schedule, and the method. No mandatory classes that conflict with your work calendar.

### Exam Format and Components

Both frameworks require exams, but the specifics differ.

**Wi2013 components (6 total):**

| Component | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|
| Lezen (Reading) | Computer exam at DUO | A2 |
| Luisteren (Listening) | Computer exam at DUO | A2 |
| Schrijven (Writing) | Computer exam at DUO | A2 |
| Spreken (Speaking) | Computer exam at DUO | A2 |
| KNM (Knowledge of Dutch Society) | Computer exam at DUO | N/A (factual knowledge) |
| ONA (Labour Market Orientation) | Portfolio submission | N/A |

You can take these in any order, at any pace, at a [DUO exam location](https://duo.nl) near you.

**Wi2021:** The exam structure depends on your assigned learning route. The B1 route targets B1-level language exams. The Z-route has different assessment criteria. The municipality and your assigned school coordinate the exam process.

For a detailed breakdown of each exam component, see our guides on [lezen (reading)](/blog/lezen-reading-exam-format-scoring), [KNM (society knowledge)](/blog/knm-exam-2026-new-format), and the [full exam walkthrough](/blog/inburgering-exam-walkthrough-2026).

### Costs

The financial picture is different too.

**Wi2013:**
- You pay for everything yourself: exam fees, study materials, courses
- Exam fees total roughly **€293** for all six components ([full cost breakdown here](/blog/inburgering-exam-costs-2026))
- No government subsidy for voluntary integrators
- No DUO loan available for voluntary integrators

**Wi2021:**
- DUO provides a loan (up to ~€10,000) to cover course fees
- The loan converts to a **gift** if you pass within the deadline
- Exam fees are covered
- But: the government controls which school you attend and monitors your progress

<div class="tip-box">Under Wi2013, you'll spend roughly €300-€500 total if you self-study and pass on the first attempt. Under Wi2021, the government covers most costs through the DUO loan — but you lose control over how and where you study.</div>

### Deadlines

**Wi2013:** If you have a mandatory obligation, you typically get **3 years** from the date of your inburgering letter to complete everything. Extensions are possible. If you're doing it voluntarily (most kennismigranten), there's **no deadline** — you go at your own pace. Your only "deadline" is when you want to apply for PR or citizenship.

**Wi2021:** You get **3 years** from the start of your learning route. The municipality monitors your progress. If you don't pass within the deadline, there are consequences — potential fines, and it affects future residence permit renewals.

### ONA (Career Orientation)

**Wi2013:** ONA is a standalone portfolio requirement. You gather evidence showing you understand the Dutch labor market — CV, cover letter, employment documents, labor market knowledge — and submit it to DUO. For professionals already working in NL, this is straightforward. Read the [full ONA guide](/blog/ona-career-orientation-explained) for details.

**Wi2021:** Career orientation is woven into your learning route. Your school and municipality handle it as part of the PIP. It's not a separate portfolio you submit independently.

## Why This Matters: Real Consequences of Getting It Wrong

This isn't academic. Here's what happens when people prepare under the wrong framework:

**Scenario 1:** A kennismigrant arrives in 2024, assumes Wi2021 applies because they arrived after 2022, and starts preparing for B1-level exams. They spend 8+ months studying for a level they don't actually need. They could have passed A2 in half the time.

**Scenario 2:** Someone with a mandatory Wi2021 obligation prepares for A2 because a friend told them "inburgering is just A2." They show up to their municipality review having prepared at the wrong level. Their learning plan needs adjustment, and they've lost months.

**Scenario 3:** A professional buys an expensive B1 course (€2,000+) when they only needed A2-level prep. That's money and time wasted on vocabulary and grammar structures that weren't required.

<div class="warning-box">Verify which law applies to you BEFORE you start studying. Check your Mijn Inburgering account, call DUO at 088 786 10 00, or visit your municipality's inburgering desk. Ten minutes of checking now can save months of wasted effort.</div>

## What This Means for Your Study Plan

Once you've confirmed which law applies, your prep strategy becomes much clearer.

**If you're Wi2013 (most kennismigranten):**
- Target **A2** across all four language exams
- Self-study is viable and common — no mandatory courses
- Take exams in whatever order suits you
- Build your ONA portfolio separately (easy if you're employed)
- Study the [new KNM format](/blog/knm-exam-2026-new-format) — it changed in July 2025
- Budget roughly **€300-€500** total
- Set your own timeline, but a realistic prep period is [4-12 weeks with focused study](/blog/how-long-prepare-inburgering-exam)

**If you're Wi2021:**
- Work with your municipality and assigned school
- Target **B1** (but know that an A2 fallback exists if B1 is demonstrably unachievable)
- Follow your PIP and attend required check-ins
- The DUO loan covers most costs
- Take the deadline seriously — 3 years goes faster than you think

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I'm a kennismigrant who arrived in 2025. Am I really under Wi2013?

Yes. Wi2021 only applies to people with a **mandatory** inburgering obligation who received their residence permit after January 1, 2022. As a kennismigrant doing inburgering voluntarily for PR or citizenship, you're under Wi2013 regardless of your arrival date. This is one of the most misunderstood aspects of the system.

### Can I switch from Wi2021 to Wi2013?

No — the law that applies to you is determined by your legal situation, not your preference. You can't opt into a different framework. However, if you believe you've been incorrectly placed under Wi2021, contact DUO to review your classification.

### What if my partner and I fall under different laws?

This is common. A kennismigrant might be under Wi2013 (voluntary), while their spouse on a dependent visa might be under Wi2021 (mandatory, arrived after 2022). Each person's inburgering is individual. You can study together, but you'll be taking different-level exams and following different processes.

### Does Wi2021's B1 requirement make it harder to get PR?

Not exactly. Under Wi2021, the B1 target is higher, but there's an A2 fallback route for people who can demonstrate they genuinely tried but couldn't reach B1. The IND still accepts A2 for PR applications when it's combined with proof of effort toward B1. That said, the process to prove you "tried hard enough" for the fallback isn't trivial.

### Where can I officially check which law applies to me?

Log into [Mijn Inburgering](https://inburgeren.nl) with your DigiD. Your account will show whether you have an inburgering obligation and under which law. If you don't have an account yet (common for voluntary integrators), call DUO at **088 786 10 00** or visit your municipality's inburgering desk.
