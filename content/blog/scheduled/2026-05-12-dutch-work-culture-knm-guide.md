# Dutch Work Culture: What Expats Need to Know for KNM

Dutch work culture runs on directness, consensus, and a work-life balance that most countries talk about but don't actually practice. Your boss probably goes by their first name. Meetings start on time and end on time. Leaving at 5 PM sharp isn't lazy — it's expected. And if someone disagrees with your idea in a meeting, they'll tell you to your face instead of sending a passive-aggressive email afterward.

For the KNM exam, work and income (werk & inkomen) is one of the core themes. The exam tests specific knowledge: types of employment contracts, how sick leave works, what the UWV does, and your rights as an employee. Living and working in the Netherlands gives you a head start, but there are details the exam asks about that you might never encounter in your day-to-day job — especially if you work in an international company bubble.

This guide covers both: the cultural reality of working in the Netherlands, and the specific facts the KNM expects you to know.

## Directness and Flat Hierarchy: It's Not Rude, It's Dutch

The first thing most expats notice about Dutch workplaces is the communication style. Blunt. Direct. No sugarcoating.

If your proposal has a flaw, a Dutch colleague will point it out in front of everyone. They're not being hostile. They're being efficient. In Dutch work culture, indirect communication wastes time. Saying "that won't work because X" is faster than hinting that "perhaps we could consider alternative approaches." You'll adjust to it. Most people say it took them about three months.

The hierarchy thing goes hand in hand with this. Most Dutch companies operate with a **flat organizational structure**. Your manager has a title, sure, but that doesn't mean they expect deference. Calling your director "meneer" or "mevrouw" would feel strange to most Dutch professionals — first names are standard at every level. Interns call the CEO "Jan." Nobody blinks.

This flatness shows up in decision-making too. The Dutch have a concept called the **poldermodel** — consensus-based decision-making where everyone affected by a decision gets a say. It comes from centuries of water management (literally — "polder" refers to reclaimed land that required cooperative maintenance). In practice, this means meetings. Lots of meetings. Decisions take longer because everyone's input is gathered. But once a decision is made, there's genuine buy-in.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>KNM context:</strong> The poldermodel isn't just workplace trivia — it's a cultural value the KNM exam can test. Understanding that Dutch society values consensus, even if it's slower, is part of knowing how the Netherlands works.</div>

## Employment Contracts: Vast vs. Tijdelijk

This is where KNM questions get specific. The Dutch system has clear rules about employment contracts, and the exam expects you to know the basics.

**Vast contract (permanent/indefinite)** — A contract with no end date. This is the gold standard in the Netherlands. It means your employer can't easily let you go — they need a valid reason and usually approval from the UWV or a court. Banks love vast contracts. Getting a mortgage is significantly easier with one.

**Tijdelijk contract (temporary/fixed-term)** — A contract with a specific end date. Common for new employees. Dutch law limits how many temporary contracts an employer can give you before they must offer a permanent one.

**The chain rule (ketenregeling):**

Your employer can give you a maximum of **3 consecutive temporary contracts** over a maximum period of **3 years**. After that, the next contract automatically becomes permanent. This is known as the "3x3 rule."

| Contract Type | Duration | Termination | Mortgage Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vast** (permanent) | No end date | Employer needs valid reason + UWV/court | Strongly preferred by banks |
| **Tijdelijk** (temporary) | Fixed end date | Ends automatically (unless renewed) | Harder to get a mortgage |
| **Oproepcontract** (on-call) | Variable hours | Flexible, fewer protections | Very difficult for mortgage |

**Other contract details the KNM tests:**

- **Proeftijd (trial period):** Maximum **1 month** for contracts of 2 years or less, **2 months** for longer contracts or permanent positions. During the trial period, either party can end the contract immediately.
- **Opzegtermijn (notice period):** Usually **1 month** for employees. Employers' notice period is longer and depends on how long you've worked there.
- **Minimum wage (minimumloon):** Set by the government and adjusted twice per year (January and July). In 2026, it's roughly **€13.68 per hour** for workers 21 and older.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Exam tip:</strong> The KNM doesn't ask you to memorize exact minimum wage amounts. But you do need to know that the minimum wage exists, that it's set by the government, and that it adjusts regularly. Know the concept, not the number.</div>

## Sick Leave: Calling In Sick the Dutch Way

The Dutch sick leave system is one of the most employee-friendly in the world. If you get sick, here's what happens:

1. **You call your employer on the first morning of illness.** Not email. Call. Most companies are strict about this. You inform your direct manager and follow any company-specific procedures (some have an absence line).
2. **Your employer pays you.** By law, your employer must continue paying at least **70% of your salary** for up to **2 years** of illness. Many collective labor agreements (CAOs) or individual contracts bump this to 100% — at least for the first year.
3. **You don't need a doctor's note.** Not immediately, anyway. The Dutch system trusts employees to self-report. Your employer can't ask what's wrong with you. They can only ask when you expect to return.
4. **The bedrijfsarts gets involved.** If your illness lasts longer than a few weeks, your employer's company doctor (bedrijfsarts) will schedule an appointment to assess your situation and create a reintegration plan.

Two years. Your employer pays your salary for up to two years of illness. Read that again if it didn't sink in. Coming from most other countries, this sounds almost unbelievable. But it's Dutch law, and the KNM absolutely tests it.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">2 years</div><div class="stat-label">Maximum period your employer must continue paying your salary during illness — at least 70%, often 100% in the first year</div></div>

**What happens after 2 years?** If you're still unable to work after 2 years, you may transition to a **WIA (Wet werk en inkomen naar arbeidsvermogen)** benefit — a disability benefit managed by the UWV. Your employment contract can then be terminated, but only through proper procedures.

## Work-Life Balance: Part-Time Is Normal

The Netherlands has the highest rate of part-time work in the EU. This isn't a sign of economic weakness — it's deliberate. The Dutch genuinely prioritize time over money to a degree that surprises most internationals.

**The numbers:**

- Standard work week: **36-40 hours** (36 is common in many sectors)
- **Roughly 26%** of Dutch men work part-time — the highest rate in Europe for men
- Wednesday afternoon off for parents with young children is extremely common
- Many professionals work 4 days per week (32 hours) by choice

**Holidays and time off:**

- Legal minimum: **20 vacation days** per year (based on full-time work)
- Most employers offer **25-30 days** through collective agreements
- Public holidays (typically 7-8 days) are on top of vacation days in most contracts
- Unused vacation days often carry over to the next year

The right to request a change in working hours is actually protected by law (Wet flexibel werken). You can ask to work fewer hours, and your employer must have a serious business reason to refuse.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Cultural note:</strong> If your Dutch colleagues leave at 5 and you stay until 7, they won't admire your dedication. They'll wonder why you can't manage your workload in normal hours. Overwork isn't a badge of honor here — it's a signal that something's off.</div>

## Dutch vs. International Work Culture: A Comparison

If you've worked in the US, UK, or Asia, the contrast with Dutch work culture can be striking.

| Aspect | Dutch Culture | Typical International |
|---|---|---|
| **Communication** | Direct, blunt, honest | Often indirect or diplomatic |
| **Hierarchy** | Flat — first names for everyone | Varies — often more formal |
| **Decision-making** | Consensus (poldermodel) | Top-down in many cultures |
| **Work hours** | Strict — leave on time | Long hours can be expected |
| **Part-time work** | Normalized, even for men | Often stigmatized |
| **Sick leave** | Employer pays 70%+ for 2 years | Varies wildly |
| **Meetings** | Start and end on time | Often run over |
| **After-work socializing** | Borrels (drinks), but limited | Dinner, karaoke, etc. |
| **Email after hours** | Generally not expected | Common in many cultures |

## UWV, WW, and the Safety Net

The KNM tests your knowledge of the Dutch social safety net for employees. Here are the key organizations and benefits:

**UWV (Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen)** — The Employee Insurance Agency. This government body handles:

- **WW (Werkloosheidswet)** — Unemployment benefits. If you lose your job (not by your own fault), you can receive WW benefits for **3 to 24 months**, depending on your work history. The amount is **75%** of your last salary for the first 2 months, then **70%** after that. You must actively apply for jobs while receiving WW.
- **WIA/WAO** — Disability benefits for people who can't work after the 2-year sick leave period.
- **Ziektewet** — Sick leave benefits for people without an employer (temp workers, freelancers in certain situations).

**To qualify for WW, you must:**

- Have lost your job through no fault of your own (not fired for misconduct, not voluntary resignation)
- Have worked at least **26 of the last 36 weeks** before becoming unemployed
- Be available for work and actively job-seeking
- Register with the UWV within one week of losing your job

**Works council (ondernemingsraad/OR):** Companies with **50 or more employees** are legally required to have a works council — an elected body of employees that has a say in major company decisions. The OR must be consulted on topics like restructuring, mergers, major policy changes, and working conditions. It's a direct expression of the poldermodel in the workplace.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Exam tip:</strong> The KNM asks about the UWV's role and what WW benefits are. You should know: UWV manages employee insurance, WW is for unemployment, and you need to have worked recently to qualify. The exact duration formulas aren't tested, but the general concepts are.</div>

## What the KNM Specifically Tests on Work

The work and income section of the KNM is practical. It's testing whether you understand the Dutch employment system well enough to know your rights and responsibilities as an employee.

**Core topics to know:**

- **Types of employment contracts** — the difference between vast and tijdelijk, and what the proeftijd (trial period) is
- **Sick leave procedures** — that you call your employer, they pay 70%+ for up to 2 years, and the bedrijfsarts (company doctor) gets involved for long-term illness
- **Employee rights** — minimum wage, vacation days, notice periods, protection against unfair dismissal
- **UWV and WW** — what UWV does, what WW benefits are for, basic eligibility
- **Works council (OR)** — what it is and which companies must have one

You won't be asked to calculate severance pay or interpret a CAO. The exam focuses on understanding the system: who does what, what your rights are, and where to go when something goes wrong.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can my employer fire me without reason in the Netherlands?

No. The Netherlands has strong dismissal protection (ontslagbescherming). Your employer needs a legally valid reason — such as poor performance (after a documented improvement process), economic necessity (reorganization), or serious misconduct. For most dismissals, they need either UWV approval or a court ruling. During your trial period (proeftijd), either party can end the contract immediately — but once that's over, the protections kick in fully.

### What's the difference between a CAO and my individual contract?

A CAO (collectieve arbeidsovereenkomst) is a collective labor agreement negotiated between employer organizations and trade unions for an entire sector or company. It sets minimum standards for salary, vacation days, sick pay, and other conditions. Your individual contract can offer *more* than the CAO, but never less. Not every sector has a CAO, but most do — roughly 80% of Dutch employees fall under one.

### Do I build up pension automatically?

Most employed people in the Netherlands build up pension through their employer's pension fund. It's typically deducted from your gross salary. This is separate from the state pension (AOW), which everyone who has lived or worked in the Netherlands accrues. The KNM may test whether you know that the Dutch pension system has multiple pillars: state pension (AOW), employer pension, and private savings.

### Is freelancing (ZZP) common in the Netherlands?

Very. The Netherlands has over **1.2 million** self-employed professionals (ZZP'ers — zelfstandigen zonder personeel). The KNM may reference self-employment as a way of working. Key difference from employment: ZZP'ers don't have sick leave coverage or employer-funded pension by default. They arrange their own insurance and retirement savings. The government has been tightening rules around "schijnzelfstandigheid" (false self-employment) — where people work as freelancers but are effectively employees.

### What should I do if I lose my job?

Register with the UWV **within one week** of your last working day. Apply for WW benefits if you qualify. You'll need to show that you're actively looking for work — the UWV monitors this. Also check your contract and any CAO for transition payment (transitievergoeding) — a severance payment your employer may owe you based on your length of service. It's roughly **one-third of a month's salary per year of employment**.
