# Spreken Exam 2025: The New Format With No Multiple Choice

In March 2025, DUO completely redesigned the Spreken (speaking) exam. The old version had a mix of multiple-choice questions and spoken responses. The new version? **100% spoken responses.** Every single answer is recorded through a microphone on the exam computer. No clicking answer options. No safety net of elimination.

That sounds scarier than it is. The level is still A2. You don't need to sound like a native speaker or deliver polished speeches. You need to be understood. Short, clear responses that answer the question — that's what passes.

But the format change means a lot of older study materials and advice are outdated. This guide covers exactly what the new Spreken exam looks like, what each of the 4 parts requires, and how to prepare when you don't have a Dutch conversation partner.

## What Changed: Old Format vs. New Format

Here's a direct comparison so you can see what shifted.

| | **Old Format (Before March 2025)** | **New Format (March 2025+)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Response type** | Mix of multiple choice + spoken | 100% spoken responses |
| **Multiple choice** | Yes, several questions | None |
| **Parts** | 2 main sections | 4 distinct parts |
| **What you do** | Answer some questions by clicking, others by speaking | Speak into a microphone for every question |
| **Recording** | Partial | All responses recorded |
| **Duration** | ~20 minutes | ~25-30 minutes |
| **Level** | A2 | A2 (unchanged) |
| **Pass mark** | ~60% | ~60% |
| **Cost** | €48 | €48 |

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Heads up:</strong> If you find Spreken study materials or practice tests that include multiple-choice questions, they're based on the old format. Since March 2025, the real exam has zero multiple choice. Make sure your practice material reflects the current format.</div>

The removal of multiple choice is the biggest shift. In the old exam, you could score points by recognizing the right answer from options — even if you couldn't produce Dutch on your own. That crutch is gone. Every point now requires you to actually speak.

Good news? The A2 bar for speaking is genuinely low. You don't need fluency. You need basic, understandable Dutch. And the new format, once you know what to expect, is very predictable.

## Exam Format at a Glance

| Detail | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Level** | A2 (Wi2013) |
| **Format** | 100% spoken responses recorded on computer |
| **Parts** | 4 |
| **Duration** | Approximately 25-30 minutes |
| **Pass mark** | Approximately 60% |
| **Cost** | €48 per attempt |
| **Administered by** | DUO at designated exam centers |

You sit at a computer with a headset (headphones + microphone). Each task appears on screen — sometimes with an image, sometimes with a written prompt, sometimes with audio you need to respond to. You speak into the microphone, and your response is recorded. A timer shows how much time you have for each response.

You can't go back and re-record. Once you've moved to the next question, your previous answer is locked in. That sounds stressful, but remember: you're giving short responses, not speeches. Most answers are 1-3 sentences.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">4 parts</div><div class="stat-label">Each tests a different speaking skill — from repeating sentences to handling real-life situations</div></div>

## The 4 Parts of the New Spreken Exam

### Part 1: Repeating Sentences (Nazeggen)

You hear a Dutch sentence through your headphones. You repeat it. That's it.

The sentences start short and simple ("Ik ga naar de winkel") and gradually get longer and more complex ("Mijn buurvrouw heeft gevraagd of ik zaterdag op haar kat kan passen"). You'll hear each sentence once, then you have a few seconds to repeat it.

**What they're testing:** Pronunciation, rhythm, and your ability to hold a Dutch sentence in short-term memory. You don't need to understand every word perfectly — but you do need to reproduce the sounds closely enough to be understood.

**The trick:** Don't try to translate the sentence in your head. Just listen to the sounds and repeat them. Treat it like an echo exercise, not a comprehension exercise. The more you think about meaning during this section, the more likely you'll stumble.

This part typically has **8-10 sentences** and takes about 5-7 minutes.

### Part 2: Describing Images (Plaatjes Beschrijven)

You see an image on screen — a photo of a situation, an event, or a scene from daily life. You describe what you see in Dutch.

Images might show: people shopping at a market, a family having dinner, someone at a bus stop in the rain, children playing in a park, a person visiting a doctor's office.

**What they're testing:** Whether you can produce basic descriptive Dutch. Can you name what you see? Can you say what's happening?

**What a good response sounds like:** "Ik zie een vrouw in een winkel. Ze koopt groente. Het is druk in de winkel." Three sentences. Simple. Clear. That's enough.

You don't need to tell a story or analyze the image. Describe what's visible. Name the people, objects, actions, and setting. Use "Ik zie..." (I see...) as your go-to starter if you get stuck.

This part typically has **5-6 images** and takes about 5-7 minutes.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Build a vocabulary of common descriptive words before the exam. People (man, vrouw, kind, kinderen), places (winkel, park, school, ziekenhuis), actions (kopen, eten, wachten, praten, lopen), weather (het regent, het is koud, de zon schijnt). These words cover the majority of image descriptions.</div>

### Part 3: Answering Questions (Vragen Beantwoorden)

You hear a question about an everyday topic — and you answer it out loud. The questions are personal and practical: your daily routine, your neighborhood, your hobbies, your work, your family.

Example questions:
- "Wat doe je graag in je vrije tijd?" (What do you like to do in your free time?)
- "Hoe ga je naar je werk?" (How do you get to work?)
- "Wat voor weer vind je het lekkerst?" (What kind of weather do you like best?)
- "Vertel iets over je buurt." (Tell something about your neighborhood.)

**What they're testing:** Whether you can talk about familiar topics in basic Dutch. They want coherent responses — not eloquent ones. Two to four sentences that actually answer the question.

**What a good response sounds like:** "Ik ga met de fiets naar mijn werk. Het duurt ongeveer twintig minuten. Soms als het regent neem ik de bus." Simple. Answers the question. Provides a small detail. Done.

This part typically has **5-6 questions** and takes about 5-8 minutes.

### Part 4: Responding to Situations (Reageren op Situaties)

This is the most practical part. You hear or read a situation description, and you need to respond as if it's really happening. It's role-play — but you only play your part.

Example situations:
- You call a restaurant to make a reservation. Say when you want to come and for how many people.
- Your colleague asks if you can work on Saturday. You can't. Explain why and suggest a different day.
- You're at the doctor and need to describe your symptoms.
- A friend invites you to a birthday party. Accept and ask what you can bring.

**What they're testing:** Whether you can handle basic social and practical interactions in Dutch. Can you make a request? Give a reason? Ask a question? Politely decline?

**What a good response sounds like:** "Ik wil graag een tafel reserveren voor vrijdagavond. We komen met vier personen. Is er plek om acht uur?" Natural. Functional. The kind of Dutch you'd actually use in real life.

This part typically has **5-6 situations** and takes about 7-10 minutes.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key insight:</strong> Parts 3 and 4 are where most people lose or gain the exam. Parts 1 and 2 are mechanical — repeat and describe. Parts 3 and 4 require you to produce your own Dutch. Practice these the most.</div>

## How Scoring Works

Your recorded responses are evaluated by trained examiners. Here's what they're listening for:

### Understandability (Highest Priority)

Can a Dutch person understand what you said? This is the main criterion. Pronunciation doesn't need to be perfect — it needs to be clear enough that your meaning comes through. An accent is fine. Mumbling isn't.

### Task Completion

Did you actually do what the task asked? If it said "make a reservation and ask about parking," did you cover both? Like the [Schrijven exam](/blog/schrijven-writing-exam-guide), hitting the content points matters more than how elegantly you do it.

### Vocabulary Range

Are you using appropriate words for the situation? You don't need advanced vocabulary. You need the right basic words — "afspraak" for appointment, "ziek" for sick, "helpen" for help. Common, practical Dutch.

### Fluency and Pronunciation

Do you speak at a reasonable pace without constant long pauses? Is your pronunciation close enough to be understood? They're not looking for perfection. They're looking for "can this person communicate in basic Dutch situations?" That's it.

## Strategies That Actually Work

### Speak, Even If It's Wrong

The worst thing you can do on the Spreken exam is stay silent. A hesitant, grammatically messy response still scores points. Silence scores zero. If you're stuck, say something. "Ik weet het niet precies, maar..." (I don't know exactly, but...) buys you thinking time while keeping you in the game.

### Prepare Your Personal Answers

Part 3 asks about your life — work, hobbies, neighborhood, daily routine, family. These topics are predictable. Write out and practice 3-4 sentences about each topic in advance. When the question comes up during the exam, you'll have a rehearsed answer ready.

Topics to prepare:
- Your daily routine
- How you get to work/school
- Your neighborhood
- Your free time and hobbies
- Your family
- Your favorite food/weather/season
- Why you came to the Netherlands

This isn't cheating. It's smart preparation. The exam tests whether you can talk about everyday topics — and practicing those topics is exactly how you get good at it.

### Learn Situation Phrases

Part 4 keeps using the same types of situations. Memorize the key phrases for each:

**Making appointments/reservations:**
- Ik wil graag een afspraak maken.
- Is er plek op [dag] om [tijd]?
- Kan ik langskomen op [dag]?

**Explaining problems:**
- Ik heb een probleem met...
- Het werkt niet.
- Het is kapot.

**Accepting/declining invitations:**
- Ja, leuk! Ik kom graag.
- Helaas kan ik niet komen. Ik moet werken.
- Kan het ook op een andere dag?

**Asking for information:**
- Kunt u mij vertellen...
- Hoe laat begint het?
- Wat kost het?

Having these templates in your head means you're never starting from zero.

### Don't Chase Perfect Pronunciation

You have an accent. Every expat has an accent. The examiners know this and expect it. What they don't accept is being impossible to understand. Focus on speaking clearly and at a steady pace rather than trying to sound Dutch. Slow and clear beats fast and mumbled.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Record yourself speaking Dutch and listen back. You'll immediately notice your own patterns — maybe you swallow endings, or rush through sentences, or pause too long between words. Recording yourself is the cheapest and most effective speaking coach available.</div>

### Use Filler Words (The Dutch Ones)

When you need a second to think, use Dutch fillers instead of going silent. "Eh...", "Nou...", "Laat me even denken..." (Let me think for a moment). These are natural in spoken Dutch — every native speaker uses them. They keep your response flowing and signal to the examiner that you're still engaged.

## How to Practice Speaking Without a Tutor

You don't need a private tutor to prepare for the Spreken exam. Here's what works:

### Talk to Yourself

Seriously. Narrate your day in Dutch while you're cooking, commuting, or showering. "Ik maak nu het eten klaar. Ik snij de uien. Het water kookt." It feels ridiculous. It works. You're building the habit of producing Dutch without pressure.

### Use Voice Recording

Record yourself answering practice questions. Listen back. Could a Dutch person understand you? Are you covering the content points? Recording creates accountability — you can't fool yourself about how you sound.

Our [Spreken practice module](/learn/spreken) lets you practice all four parts of the new format with recording and playback. It mirrors the real exam structure so there are no surprises on test day.

### Shadow Dutch Audio

Listen to Dutch audio (podcasts, news, videos) and repeat what you hear immediately — slightly behind the speaker, like an echo. This trains your mouth to form Dutch sounds and your brain to process Dutch at natural speed. Ten minutes a day of shadowing does more for pronunciation than an hour of reading grammar rules.

### Practice With AI or Language Exchange Partners

AI conversation tools and language exchange apps give you a low-pressure way to practice producing Dutch. You won't get the same feedback as a human tutor, but you'll get reps. And reps are what build comfort.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Preparing with old-format materials**

Any Spreken practice that includes multiple-choice questions is based on the pre-March 2025 format. It won't hurt to do them, but they won't prepare you for the actual experience of speaking every answer. Make sure your main practice uses the new format.

**Mistake 2: Giving one-word answers**

"Ja" and "nee" don't score well, even when the question technically allows them. "Houd je van koken?" — don't just say "Ja." Say "Ja, ik kook graag. Ik maak vaak Italiaans eten." Expand. Give detail. Show you can use Dutch, not just recognize it.

**Mistake 3: Speaking too fast**

Nerves make people rush. Fast speech in a second language is almost always harder to understand than slow speech. Take a breath between sentences. A deliberate pace sounds more confident and more understandable.

**Mistake 4: Going silent when stuck**

Silence is your biggest enemy on this exam. Say something. Anything. "Sorry, ik begrijp de vraag niet helemaal" (Sorry, I don't fully understand the question) is better than dead air. The microphone is recording, and every second of silence is a missed opportunity to show what you know.

**Mistake 5: Ignoring Part 1 practice**

People focus on Parts 3 and 4 because they seem harder. But Part 1 (repeating sentences) is free points if you've practiced — and surprisingly easy to botch if you haven't. Long sentences in Dutch collapse in your memory if you haven't trained your auditory recall. Practice this part specifically.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can the examiner hear me in real time?

No. Your responses are recorded and evaluated later by trained examiners. You're alone with the computer. There's no live conversation, no back-and-forth, and no one watching you while you speak.

### What happens if I don't understand a question?

You can listen to the audio prompt again for Part 1 (repeating) and Part 3 (questions). For other parts, the prompt stays on screen. If you still don't understand, say what you can — a partial response scores more than silence.

### How long should my responses be?

For Parts 2, 3, and 4: aim for **2-4 sentences**. Enough to cover the task requirements without rambling. For Part 1, repeat the sentence as closely as you can — that's it.

### Can I use English if I get stuck?

Don't. English words in your response won't earn points and signal that you're below A2. If you can't remember a Dutch word, describe it in simpler Dutch or skip that detail and cover the other content points instead.

### Is the new format harder than the old one?

Different is more accurate. The old format let you pick up points through multiple choice without producing Dutch. That's gone. But the A2 level hasn't changed, and the grading criteria are still forgiving. If you can handle basic Dutch conversations in your daily life — ordering coffee, calling a doctor, chatting with a neighbor — you can handle this exam.

## Your Next Steps

The new Spreken format rewards one thing above all: practice producing spoken Dutch. You can't cram for a speaking exam the way you might cram vocabulary for a reading test. You need to have spoken Dutch out loud — many times, in different situations — before you sit down at that exam computer.

Start here:

1. **Practice the new format** — our [Spreken practice module](/learn/spreken) covers all 4 parts with recording and playback
2. **Prepare your personal topics** — write and rehearse 3-4 sentences about your daily life, work, hobbies, neighborhood
3. **Read the full exam picture** — our [complete exam guide](/blog/inburgering-exam-guide-professionals-2026) shows how Spreken fits with the other five components
4. **Check out common mistakes** — our guide on [mistakes expats make](/blog/inburgering-mistakes-expats-avoid) covers the Spreken traps that trip people up most
5. **Build your schedule** — use the [30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) to balance speaking practice with your other exam prep

The Spreken exam isn't testing whether you sound Dutch. It's testing whether a Dutch person could understand you in a basic everyday situation. That's a lower bar than most people realize. Practice consistently, speak clearly, and don't go silent — you'll do fine.
