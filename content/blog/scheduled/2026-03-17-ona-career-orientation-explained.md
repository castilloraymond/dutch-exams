# ONA Explained: The Career Orientation Requirement for Inburgering

ONA (Orientatie op de Nederlandse Arbeidsmarkt) is the one inburgering component that isn't actually an exam. It's a **portfolio requirement** — you prove you understand the Dutch labor market by gathering documents and evidence, then submit the whole package to DUO for review. For kennismigranten who already work in the Netherlands, this is usually the simplest component of the entire inburgering process.

That said, "simple" doesn't mean "impossible to mess up." People get tripped up because the requirements aren't obvious, the submission process is clunky, and DUO's feedback on rejections is... minimal. This guide walks you through everything: what ONA is, both routes to complete it, what goes in the portfolio, and how to get it approved the first time.

## What Is ONA and Why Does It Exist?

ONA stands for **Orientatie op de Nederlandse Arbeidsmarkt** — Orientation on the Dutch Labour Market. The Dutch government wants proof that you understand how work functions in the Netherlands. Not just that you *have* a job, but that you understand employment contracts, worker rights, how to find work, and how the system around employment operates.

<div class="takeaway-box">ONA is not a test. There is no exam date, no timer, no score. You build a portfolio of evidence and submit it to DUO for approval.</div>

ONA applies under **Wi2013** rules — which is the framework most kennismigranten and voluntary integrators fall under. If you're unsure which law applies to you, check out [our breakdown of Wi2013 vs Wi2021](/blog/wi2013-vs-wi2021-which-rules-apply).

Here's the good news for professionals already working in the Netherlands: you likely already have most of what you need. Pay slips, an employment contract, a LinkedIn profile — these are all pieces of your ONA puzzle.

## Two Routes: Course vs Portfolio

You've got two options to complete ONA. Both end with DUO receiving a portfolio. The difference is how you build it.

| | **64-Hour ONA Course** | **Self-Assembled Portfolio** |
|---|---|---|
| **How it works** | Take a structured course at an approved school; they help build your portfolio | Gather all required evidence yourself and submit directly |
| **Time commitment** | 64 hours of classes + homework | Varies — could be a few hours if you already have the documents |
| **Cost** | Varies by school (typically **€500-€1,500**) | **€0** (just your time) |
| **Best for** | People not yet working in NL, career changers, those wanting guidance | Professionals already employed in the Netherlands |
| **Portfolio assembly** | School does most of the work | You do everything yourself |
| **Submission** | School may submit on your behalf | You submit directly to DUO |

For most expat professionals reading this? The portfolio route is the obvious choice. You already work here. You already understand the labor market. Paying over a thousand euros for someone to tell you how Dutch employment contracts work — when you're already on one — doesn't make much sense.

<div class="tip-box">If you're currently employed in the Netherlands on a kennismigrant visa, the self-assembled portfolio route will save you hundreds of euros and dozens of hours. The course route is really designed for people who need to learn about the Dutch labor market from scratch.</div>

## What Goes in the ONA Portfolio

This is where it gets specific. DUO expects a portfolio that demonstrates your understanding of and participation in the Dutch labor market. The exact requirements can vary slightly, but here's what you should include:

### Required Documents

**1. A Dutch-language CV (curriculum vitae)**

Not your English resume with Google Translate slapped on it. A proper Dutch-format CV. The format matters — Dutch CVs have a specific structure (personal details, work experience, education, skills, hobbies). Keep it to **1-2 pages**.

**2. A job application letter in Dutch (sollicitatiebrief)**

Write a sample application letter for a realistic position. It doesn't need to be for a real vacancy, but it should follow Dutch conventions. Address it to a specific company, explain your motivation, reference your skills. About **one page**.

**3. Proof of employment or job-seeking activities**

This is where professionals have it easy. Include:
- Your **employment contract** (arbeidsovereenkomst)
- Recent **pay slips** (loonstroken) — at least 2-3 months
- A **reference letter** from your employer (optional but strengthens the portfolio)

If you're between jobs: include evidence of job applications, registration with employment agencies, or volunteer work.

**4. Evidence of labor market knowledge**

Show you understand how working in the Netherlands actually functions:
- A summary of **employee rights** (vakantiedagen, ziekteverlof, ontslagrecht)
- Understanding of **Dutch tax system basics** (loonbelasting, toeslagen)
- Knowledge of **UWV** and its role
- Awareness of **workplace norms** (directness in meetings, lunch culture, borrels)

**5. Proof of networking or professional development**

This could be:
- LinkedIn profile (screenshot showing connections, activity)
- Membership in professional associations
- Attendance at networking events, workshops, or conferences
- Training certificates

### Putting It Together

Organize everything in a **clear folder structure** — either physical or digital. Label each section. Include a table of contents. DUO reviewers process a lot of these, so make their job easy. A messy, disorganized portfolio is more likely to get sent back for revisions.

<div class="warning-box">All documents should be in Dutch or accompanied by a Dutch translation. Your English employment contract alone won't cut it — include a translated version or a Dutch-language summary alongside it.</div>

## How to Submit Your ONA Portfolio to DUO

The submission process works like this:

**Step 1: Prepare your portfolio** following the document requirements above. Double-check that everything is included and properly labeled.

**Step 2: Register at DUO** through the [Mijn Inburgering portal](https://inburgeren.nl) using your DigiD. You need an active inburgering file with DUO — if you haven't registered for any exams yet, you'll need to set this up first.

**Step 3: Submit the portfolio.** You can submit it digitally through the portal or by post to DUO. Digital is faster and gives you a confirmation receipt. If sending by post, use registered mail (aangetekend) so you have tracking.

**Step 4: Wait for DUO's review.** This typically takes **4-8 weeks**. During busy periods, it can stretch longer.

**Step 5: Receive your result.** DUO will either approve your portfolio or send it back with revision requests. If revisions are needed, they'll tell you what's missing — though the feedback isn't always crystal clear.

<div class="tip-box">Unlike the language exams, there's no fee to submit your ONA portfolio. The ONA component itself costs €0 at DUO. The only costs are if you take a course or need translations done.</div>

## Common ONA Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)

Having seen plenty of people go through this process, here are the mistakes that keep coming up:

**Writing the CV and cover letter in English.** Everything must be in Dutch. Even if your actual job is 100% English-speaking, DUO wants to see you can present yourself professionally in Dutch. Get someone to proofread it — grammatical errors won't get you rejected, but a clearly machine-translated document might raise eyebrows.

**Submitting a portfolio that's too thin.** One pay slip and a LinkedIn screenshot isn't enough. DUO wants to see breadth. Cover all five document categories. More evidence is better than less, within reason.

**Forgetting to show labor market *knowledge*.** Having a job proves you participate in the labor market. It doesn't prove you *understand* it. Include that summary of employee rights, tax basics, and UWV functions. This is the section most people skip, and it's often the reason portfolios get sent back.

**Not including a table of contents.** Sounds trivial. It's not. A well-organized portfolio signals that you took the requirement seriously. DUO reviewers appreciate being able to find things quickly.

**Waiting until the last minute.** DUO's review process takes weeks, and revision requests add more weeks on top. If ONA is the last component standing between you and your diploma, build in a buffer. Start **at least 3 months** before you need it finalized.

## ONA for Kennismigranten: Why This Is Your Easy Win

If you're already working in the Netherlands as a kennismigrant, ONA should be the least stressful part of your inburgering process. You've got the employment contract. You've got pay slips. You live the Dutch labor market every day.

The only real effort is writing a CV and cover letter in Dutch and pulling together some evidence of your labor market knowledge. Compared to preparing for the [lezen](/blog/lezen-reading-exam-format-scoring), [luisteren](/blog/luisteren-exam-format-scoring), [schrijven](/blog/schrijven-writing-exam-guide), and [spreken](/blog/spreken-speaking-exam-new-format-2025) exams? This is a weekend afternoon project.

That's why experienced integrators often recommend doing ONA early in the process. Knock it out while you're studying for the harder exams. One less thing hanging over your head.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does DUO take to review an ONA portfolio?

Typically **4-8 weeks**, though it can take longer during peak periods. If your portfolio is sent back for revisions, add another 4-8 weeks after resubmission. Plan accordingly — this isn't something you can rush at the end of your inburgering timeline.

### Can I submit ONA before finishing my other exams?

Yes. There's no required order for inburgering components under Wi2013. You can submit your ONA portfolio at any point — before, during, or after your language exams. Many people submit it early to get it out of the way.

### What happens if DUO rejects my ONA portfolio?

DUO will send you feedback indicating what's missing or insufficient. You revise and resubmit. There's no limit on resubmissions and no additional fee. The main cost is time — each review cycle takes weeks.

### Do I need to be currently employed to complete ONA?

No. If you're between jobs, you can demonstrate labor market orientation through job applications, volunteer work, training activities, and evidence of your job search process. Being employed makes it easier, but it's not a requirement.

### Is ONA different under Wi2021?

Under Wi2021, career orientation is integrated into the learning route assigned by your municipality rather than being a standalone portfolio submission. But most kennismigranten and voluntary integrators fall under Wi2013 rules, where ONA is the standalone portfolio format described in this guide. Not sure which applies to you?
