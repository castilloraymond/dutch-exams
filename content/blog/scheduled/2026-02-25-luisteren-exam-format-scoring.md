# How the Luisteren (Listening) Exam Works: Format, Scoring & Tips

The Luisteren (listening) exam tests whether you can understand spoken Dutch in everyday situations. You'll hear short audio clips — conversations, announcements, voicemails — and answer multiple-choice questions about what was said. The pass mark is roughly **60%**, the level is **A2**, and you get to hear each audio clip **twice**.

If the [Lezen exam](/blog/lezen-reading-exam-format-scoring) is reading the mail you get from the gemeente, the Luisteren exam is understanding the phone call from your huisarts. Same A2 level. Same multiple-choice format. But your ears are doing the heavy lifting instead of your eyes, and that changes the game.

This guide breaks down exactly what happens during the Luisteren exam, what kinds of audio you'll hear, how scoring works, and the strategies that actually help you pass.

## Exam Format at a Glance

Like all inburgering language exams, the Luisteren is computer-based and taken at a DUO exam center. You'll wear headphones and control your own audio playback.

| Detail | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Level** | A2 (Wi2013) |
| **Format** | Multiple choice |
| **Number of questions** | Approximately 25 |
| **Time limit** | 45 minutes |
| **Audio plays** | Twice per clip |
| **Pass mark** | Approximately 60% correct |
| **Cost** | €48 per attempt |
| **Administered by** | DUO at designated exam centers |

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">45 min</div><div class="stat-label">For ~25 questions — about 1.5 to 2 minutes per question including audio playback</div></div>

Here's how it works in practice: you sit at a computer with headphones. The screen shows a question (or sometimes a short setup sentence), and you press play to hear the audio. After the clip finishes, you see the answer options and select one. You can replay the audio one more time. Then you move on.

You control the pace. The 45-minute clock is running, but you decide when to hit play and when to move to the next question. That bit of control is important — use it.

## How It Compares to the Lezen Exam

Since most people take Lezen and Luisteren close together, here's a direct comparison.

| | **Lezen (Reading)** | **Luisteren (Listening)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Input** | Text on screen | Audio through headphones |
| **Time limit** | 65 minutes | 45 minutes |
| **Questions** | ~25 | ~25 |
| **Format** | Multiple choice | Multiple choice |
| **Pass mark** | ~60% | ~60% |
| **Can review?** | Yes — re-read any text | Yes — replay audio once more |
| **Pacing** | Self-paced | Self-paced (you press play) |
| **Main challenge** | Vocabulary recognition | Catching spoken words at natural speed |

The biggest difference? With Lezen, you can stare at a word for 30 seconds and figure it out. With Luisteren, the audio moves at a fixed pace. You either catch it or you don't. That's why the replay is so valuable — and why training your ear before exam day matters more than cramming vocabulary lists.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key insight:</strong> Luisteren and Lezen test the same A2 vocabulary and grammar — just through different channels. Studying for one strengthens the other. Don't treat them as completely separate exams.</div>

## What Kinds of Audio Clips Appear?

Every audio clip on the Luisteren exam reflects a situation you'd actually encounter living in the Netherlands. The speakers talk at a natural-but-clear pace, roughly what you'd hear from someone who knows they're talking to a non-native speaker.

### Short Conversations

Two people talking about an everyday topic. A colleague asking about weekend plans. A parent calling a school. Neighbors discussing a package delivery. These are usually 4-8 exchanges long.

The question might ask: what did person A want? What did they agree to do? When are they meeting?

### Phone Calls and Voicemails

Someone leaves a voicemail at a doctor's office. A customer calls a store about opening hours. A landlord phones about a maintenance visit. These clips tend to have one main speaker delivering specific information — a date, a time, a request.

Listen for numbers, days, and times. They're almost always the key detail being tested.

### Announcements and Instructions

A recorded announcement at a train station. An automated message when you call a business. A public announcement at a library or community center. These are short, factual, and packed with specific details.

The tricky part? Announcements often contain multiple pieces of information, and the question only asks about one. Don't try to memorize everything. Focus on what the question is asking.

### Informal Conversations

Friends chatting about plans. A quick exchange at a shop. Someone asking for directions. These sound more natural and casual than the other categories. The Dutch might be slightly faster, with more filler words like "eh," "nou," and "zeg."

Don't panic if you miss a word in these clips. Casual conversations are full of redundancy — people repeat themselves, rephrase things, add context. The meaning usually comes through even if you miss individual words.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Pay special attention to question words in the questions themselves. "Wanneer" (when) means you're listening for a time or date. "Waarom" (why) means you're listening for a reason. "Wie" (who) means you're listening for a person. Knowing what type of answer you need helps you filter the audio.</div>

## How Scoring Works

Scoring is straightforward — and identical to how Lezen works.

- **Each question is worth the same** — no bonus points, no weighted sections
- **No penalty for wrong answers** — guess if you're unsure. Always.
- **Pass mark is approximately 60%** — on ~25 questions, that's roughly **15 correct answers**
- **Results are pass/fail** — you get "voldoende" or "onvoldoende." No detailed score breakdown.

Results come through your Mijn Inburgering account within about **8 weeks**. Same timeline as all other inburgering components.

Here's what that 60% threshold means in practice: you can miss about 10 questions and still pass. That's a significant buffer. You don't need to understand every word of every clip. You need to catch enough of the right details on enough of the questions.

## Strategies That Actually Work

### Listen Before You Read the Options

When you press play, don't stare at the answer choices. Focus entirely on the audio. Let the clip paint a picture in your head. After it finishes, then look at the options. This prevents you from hearing what you expect to hear instead of what's actually being said.

### Use the Second Play Strategically

You get to hear each clip twice. Don't just hit replay automatically. After the first listen, read the question and answer options carefully. Now you know exactly what detail you're hunting for. The second listen becomes a targeted search instead of a general re-listen.

This alone can be worth 3-4 extra correct answers on exam day.

### Don't Translate in Your Head

This is the hardest habit to break, and the most important one. If you're hearing Dutch, translating to English, then picking an answer, you're burning precious processing time. At A2 level, you should be able to connect common Dutch words directly to their meaning.

How do you get there? Practice. The more Dutch audio you hear, the less you need to translate. There's no shortcut here — just repetition.

### Catch the Numbers

A huge percentage of Luisteren questions ask about specific numbers: times, dates, prices, addresses, phone numbers. Dutch number pronunciation trips up a lot of people, especially the teens (13-19) and the reversed order of two-digit numbers (vijfentwintig = 25, not 52).

Practice hearing Dutch numbers until the pattern is automatic. This is one of the highest-return skills you can build for the Luisteren exam.

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Watch out:</strong> Dutch says two-digit numbers "backwards" from English. "Drieëntwintig" is 23 (literally "three-and-twenty"). If you hear "vijfenveertig," that's 45, not 54. Drill this until it's automatic — number questions are easy points if you've practiced, and frustrating traps if you haven't.</div>

### Don't Get Stuck

If a clip completely flies over your head, that's okay. Pick the answer that seems most logical based on whatever you did catch, and move on. One lost question isn't the difference between passing and failing. Three lost questions because you spent all your time replaying one tough clip? That could be.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Not wearing the headphones properly**

Sounds silly. But in a room with other test-takers clicking and shifting, outside noise can interfere if your headphones aren't on snugly. Make sure the fit is good before you start. Adjust the volume on the first question.

**Mistake 2: Reading too much into the question**

The questions are A2 level. The correct answer is usually the most straightforward interpretation of what you heard. If you find yourself reasoning through three layers of logic, you've gone too far.

**Mistake 3: Panicking when you miss a word**

You will miss words. Everyone does. A2 comprehension doesn't mean catching every syllable — it means understanding the gist and the key details. If you understood what the conversation was about and caught the main point, you probably have enough to answer correctly.

**Mistake 4: Not practicing with audio before exam day**

Reading Dutch and listening to Dutch are different skills. People who've only studied with textbooks and flashcards often struggle with Luisteren because they've never trained their ears. You need hours of Dutch audio input before the exam. Not days. Hours.

## How to Prepare: A Practical Approach

### Build Your Listening Base

Start with slow, clear Dutch audio. Podcasts for learners, Dutch children's shows, NOS Jeugdjournaal (the kids' news). These use simple vocabulary at a manageable pace. Once you can follow along without pausing, move to regular-speed content.

Good sources for A2-level listening:
- **NOS Jeugdjournaal** — daily kids' news in clear Dutch
- **Dutch podcasts for learners** — search "Nederlands leren podcast"
- **Supermarket self-checkout machines** — seriously, they speak slowly and use common words
- **NS train announcements** — repeat the same patterns, great for drilling numbers and place names

### Practice With Exam-Format Questions

Listening to Dutch radio is great for exposure, but it doesn't prepare you for the specific format of answering questions about what you heard. You need practice that mirrors the real exam — audio clip, question, answer options.

Our [Luisteren practice module](/learn/luisteren) is built exactly for this. Same format as DUO, with A2-level audio clips and multiple-choice questions. You can replay, check your answers, and track your progress.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">70%+</div><div class="stat-label">Aim for this score consistently in practice before booking the real exam</div></div>

### Train Your Numbers

Spend dedicated time on Dutch number listening. Have someone read random numbers to you in Dutch. Use number practice exercises. Quiz yourself on times and dates. This is boring and repetitive — and it's worth more points on the exam than almost any other single skill.

### Combine With Your Other Exam Prep

If you're following a [study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan), you're already building vocabulary that helps with Luisteren. Every Dutch word you learn to read is a word you can learn to hear. Pair your reading practice with audio versions of similar content. If you studied healthcare vocabulary for the [KNM exam](/blog/knm-exam-2026-new-format), listen to Dutch audio about making doctor's appointments.

Everything reinforces everything else. That's the upside of taking multiple exam components — the vocab overlaps massively.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I adjust the volume during the exam?

Yes. You have volume controls on the computer. Adjust them during the first question to make sure you can hear clearly. Don't be shy about turning it up — you need to hear every detail, and the headphones are designed to prevent sound leaking to other candidates.

### What if I don't understand the audio at all?

Pick the answer that seems most logical based on the question setup and any words you did catch, then move on. There's no penalty for guessing, and spending 5 minutes on one impossible question hurts more than getting it wrong.

### Is the audio faster than what I hear in language classes?

It's at natural conversational speed, but on the slower side of natural. Think of how a Dutch person talks to a foreign colleague — clear, deliberate, but not artificially slow. If you can follow a simple conversation with a Dutch speaker who isn't rushing, you can handle the exam audio.

### Should I take Luisteren before or after Lezen?

Most people find Lezen slightly easier and take it first. That's a solid approach — it gets your first pass under your belt and builds confidence. But if your listening skills are stronger than your reading (common for people who've been living in the Netherlands and absorbing spoken Dutch), doing Luisteren first works too. Check our [exam walkthrough](/blog/inburgering-exam-walkthrough-2026) for recommended sequencing of all components.

### How soon can I retake if I fail?

You can rebook after about **2 weeks**. But don't just rebook blindly — identify what tripped you up. Was it numbers? Speed? Vocabulary gaps? Target those specific weaknesses before your retake. Two weeks of focused listening practice can make a noticeable difference.

## Your Next Steps

The Luisteren exam is very passable at A2 level — the audio is clear, you get two listens, and the questions are multiple-choice. What trips people up isn't the difficulty of the Dutch. It's not having enough hours of listening practice before exam day.

Start here:

1. **Benchmark your level** — [try a free listening assessment](/try) to see where you stand right now
2. **Practice with exam-format questions** — work through our [Luisteren practice module](/learn/luisteren) to get comfortable with the real format
