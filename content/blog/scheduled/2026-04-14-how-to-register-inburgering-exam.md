# How to Register for the Inburgering Exam: Step by Step

You register for the inburgering exam through DUO's online portal at [inburgeren.nl](https://inburgeren.nl), using your DigiD to log in. From there you pick which exam component you want to take, choose a date and location, and pay online — roughly **€50 per component**. The whole booking process takes about 15 minutes, assuming you already have DigiD set up.

If you don't have DigiD yet, add 1-2 weeks to your timeline. That single prerequisite trips up more people than the exam itself. Let's walk through everything from start to finish.

## Before You Start: What You'll Need

Gather these before you sit down to register. Missing any one of them means you'll hit a wall halfway through the process.

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **BSN** (Burgerservicenummer) | Your Dutch citizen service number. You got this when you registered at the gemeente. |
| **DigiD** | Digital identity for Dutch government services. Takes 1-2 weeks to activate if you don't have one. |
| **Valid ID** | Passport or residence permit (verblijfsvergunning). You'll need the same ID on exam day. |
| **Dutch bank account or iDEAL** | Payment is via iDEAL. International credit cards don't work on the DUO portal. |
| **Email address** | For confirmation messages from DUO. |

<div class="warning-box">The entire Mijn Inburgering portal is in Dutch. There's no English option. If your Dutch isn't strong enough to read the interface yet, ask a Dutch-speaking friend to sit with you during registration — or use Google Translate on the page. Don't guess your way through form fields.</div>

## Step 1: Get Your DigiD

If you already have DigiD, skip to Step 2. If not, here's the process.

Go to [digid.nl](https://www.digid.nl) and click "DigiD aanvragen" (request DigiD). You'll enter your BSN, postal code, and house number. DUO sends an activation code to your home address by regular mail.

**This takes 5-7 business days.** No way to speed it up. Plan accordingly.

Once the letter arrives, go back to digid.nl, enter the activation code, and set your password. You can also set up the DigiD app on your phone for easier login — it uses a QR code scan instead of typing SMS codes every time.

<div class="tip-box">Set up the DigiD app while you're at it. You'll use DigiD for lots of Dutch government services — taxes, healthcare declarations, municipality appointments. It's not just for inburgering.</div>

**Common DigiD problems:**
- **Wrong address on file?** DigiD uses your BRP (municipal registration) address. If you moved recently and didn't update your registration, the activation letter goes to your old address.
- **BSN not recognized?** Double-check the number on your residence permit or the letter you received when you registered at the gemeente.
- **Activation code expired?** Codes are valid for 20 days. If yours expired, you need to request a new one. Same 5-7 day wait.

## Step 2: Log In to Mijn Inburgering

Go to [inburgeren.nl](https://inburgeren.nl) and click "Inloggen" (log in). You'll authenticate via DigiD — either by scanning the QR code with the DigiD app or entering your username, password, and SMS verification code.

Once logged in, you'll land on your personal "Mijn Inburgering" dashboard. This shows:

- Your personal details (name, BSN)
- Your inburgering status (deadline if you have a mandatory requirement, or voluntary status)
- Exam results for any components you've already taken
- Options to book new exams

If this is your first time logging in, the dashboard will be mostly empty. That's normal.

## Step 3: Choose Your Exam Component

Click "Examen inplannen" (schedule exam) or the equivalent booking option on your dashboard.

You'll see the six inburgering components:

| Component | Dutch Name | What It Is |
|---|---|---|
| **KNM** | Kennis van de Nederlandse Maatschappij | Dutch society knowledge — multiple choice |
| **Lezen** | Lezen | Reading comprehension — multiple choice |
| **Luisteren** | Luisteren | Listening comprehension — multiple choice |
| **Schrijven** | Schrijven | Writing — emails, forms, short messages |
| **Spreken** | Spreken | Speaking — recorded oral responses |
| **ONA** | Oriëntatie op de Nederlandse Arbeidsmarkt | Career orientation — portfolio submission |

**You book one component at a time.** Pick whichever you want to take next. Not sure which to start with? Our guide on [which exam to take first](/blog/which-inburgering-exam-first) covers the strategic order.

<div class="takeaway-box">You don't have to book all six at once. Most people book one, take it, then book the next. This gives you flexibility to adjust your study plan based on results.</div>

## Step 4: Select a Location and Date

After choosing your component, the portal shows available exam dates and locations. Exam centers exist across the Netherlands — you're not limited to your home city.

**Major exam locations include:** Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Eindhoven, Groningen, Arnhem, Zwolle, and several smaller cities. The exact list depends on which component you're booking — not every location offers every exam type every week.

Here's what to know about picking your slot:

**Book 2-3 months ahead.** Randstad locations (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague) fill up fast. If you need a specific date — say, before a visa deadline — don't wait.

**Morning vs. afternoon?** Most people prefer morning slots when they're fresh. These disappear first. Afternoon slots are usually easier to find.

**Check neighboring cities.** Amsterdam fully booked? Look at Haarlem, Leiden, or Almere. Same exam, different building. A short train ride is better than waiting another month.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">2-3 months</div><div class="stat-label">Recommended advance booking time, especially for Randstad exam centers</div></div>

## Step 5: Pay Online

Once you've confirmed your date and location, you'll be directed to pay via **iDEAL** (the Dutch online payment system linked to your bank account).

| Component | Cost per Attempt |
|---|---|
| KNM | ~€50 |
| Lezen | ~€48 |
| Luisteren | ~€48 |
| Schrijven | ~€48 |
| Spreken | ~€48 |
| ONA | No separate exam fee (portfolio-based) |

**Total across all five exams: roughly €240-250.** That's assuming you pass each one on the first try. Retakes cost the same amount per attempt — there's no discount.

After payment, you'll receive a confirmation email from DUO with your exam date, time, location, and a reference number. Save this email. Print it or screenshot it on your phone.

<div class="warning-box">iDEAL is the only payment option. You need a Dutch or EU bank account that supports iDEAL. International credit cards (Visa, Mastercard) won't work on this portal. If you don't have a Dutch bank account yet, open one before trying to register.</div>

## What to Bring on Exam Day

Show up at least **15 minutes early**. Bring:

- **Valid photo ID** — the same passport or residence permit you used during registration. Your name and photo must match. An expired ID will be rejected.
- **Exam confirmation** — printed or on your phone. Not always checked, but have it ready.
- That's it. No pens, no paper, no phone (phones are stored in a locker or bag during the exam). The exam center provides everything you need.

**Do NOT bring:**
- Dictionaries
- Notes or study materials
- Smart watches
- Electronic devices (turned off and stored before entering the exam room)

## Timeline: From "I Should Register" to Exam Day

Here's a realistic timeline if you're starting from scratch:

| Week | Action |
|---|---|
| **Week 1** | Request DigiD at digid.nl. Start studying for your first component. |
| **Week 2** | Receive DigiD activation letter. Activate your account. |
| **Week 2-3** | Log in to inburgeren.nl. Browse available dates. Book your first exam 2-3 months out. |
| **Weeks 3-10** | Study for your booked exam. |
| **Week 10-12** | Take the exam. Book your next component. |
| **Week 18-20** | Receive results by post (~8 weeks after exam). |

<div class="tip-box">Don't wait for official results before booking and studying for your next exam. You'll have a good sense of how you did right after the test. If you felt confident, start prepping for the next component immediately.</div>

## Common Registration Mistakes

**Waiting too long to book.** The number one mistake. People study for weeks, feel ready, then discover there's no available slot for 6 weeks. Book early and study toward the date.

**Not having DigiD ready.** If you need inburgering and don't have DigiD yet, stop reading and go request it right now. Everything in this process depends on it.

**Booking the wrong exam type.** The portal shows different exam options depending on whether you fall under Wi2013 or Wi2021 rules. If you're not sure which applies to you, [check our guide on Wi2013 vs. Wi2021](/blog/wi2013-vs-wi2021-which-rules-apply) before booking.

**Using an expired ID.** Your ID must be valid on exam day. If your passport or residence permit expires before your exam date, renew it first. DUO will turn you away at the door — no exceptions, no refunds.

**Forgetting to update your BRP address.** If you've moved, update your municipal registration. DUO sends results and correspondence to your BRP address. Wrong address means lost results.

## After the Exam: What Happens Next

You leave the exam center and... wait. Results aren't instant.

**Results arrive by post** to your BRP address, typically within **8 weeks**. Yes, physical mail. You can also check results online through the Mijn Inburgering portal, though these sometimes appear a few days before or after the letter.

If you passed: congratulations. One component down. Book the next one.

If you didn't pass: rebook as soon as you're eligible. There's no limit on retakes. Analyze what went wrong — was it vocabulary? Time management? Exam format unfamiliarity? — and adjust your study approach. Our guide on [common mistakes expats make](/blog/inburgering-mistakes-expats-avoid) covers the most frequent issues.

Once you've passed all six components, DUO issues your **inburgeringsdiploma**. This is the document you need for [permanent residence](/blog/permanent-residence-netherlands-roadmap) or citizenship applications.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I register if I'm doing inburgering voluntarily?

Yes. The portal works the same whether inburgering is mandatory or voluntary for you. Kennismigranten and other exempt groups can still register and take the exams. You'll just see "vrijwillig" (voluntary) on your dashboard instead of a deadline. Check [whether inburgering applies to your situation](/blog/inburgering-exemptions-guide) if you're unsure.

### What if there are no exam slots available near me?

Expand your search radius. The exam is identical at every location — content, difficulty, format. Traveling to a different city is annoying but faster than waiting for a local slot to open up. You can also check back regularly, as slots sometimes open when other candidates cancel.

### Can I cancel or reschedule my exam?

Yes, but only up to a certain deadline before the exam date (typically 4 weeks). After that, you forfeit your fee. Check the exact cancellation policy on the DUO confirmation email.

### Do I need to register separately for each component?

Yes. Each component is a separate booking with its own date, location, and payment. You go through the same process six times (five times if you count ONA separately, since it's a portfolio submission rather than a booked exam slot).

### What's the difference between the inburgering exam and the NT2 exam?

The inburgering exam tests at **A2 level** and is specifically for the civic integration requirement. The NT2 (Nederlands als Tweede Taal) exam tests at **B1 or B2 level** and is used for higher education admission or professional certification. Different exams, different purposes, different registration portals. For the path to PR or citizenship, you need the inburgering exam.
