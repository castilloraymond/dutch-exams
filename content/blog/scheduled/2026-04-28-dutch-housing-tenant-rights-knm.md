# Dutch Housing & Tenant Rights for Expats (KNM Guide)

The Dutch housing market is one of the most regulated in Europe. Tenants have strong legal protections, rent increases are capped by law, and landlords can't just kick you out because they feel like it. If you're renting in the Netherlands, you have more rights than you probably realize.

That's good news for your daily life. It's also good news for the KNM exam — housing (huisvesting) is one of the core topics under the "Wonen" theme, and the questions are very specific. Knowing the difference between social and private housing, understanding what the huurcommissie does, and knowing how to register your address aren't just nice-to-know facts. They're exam points waiting to be collected.

This guide covers both sides: how the Dutch housing system actually works in practice, and exactly what the KNM expects you to know about it.

## Social Housing vs. Private Rental: The Two-Track System

The Netherlands has a split housing market that confuses most newcomers. There are two completely separate rental systems operating side by side, each with different rules, different prices, and different waiting lists.

**Sociale huur (social housing)** is subsidized rental housing managed by woningcorporaties (housing associations). These are non-profit organizations that own and maintain affordable rental properties. The rent is capped — in 2026, the maximum rent for social housing is around **€879.66 per month**. To qualify, your household income must fall below a specific threshold (roughly **€44,035** for single-person households in 2026).

**Vrije sector (private/free sector)** is everything above that rent cap. No income requirements, no waiting lists through the housing association system, but also no rent cap. This is where most expats end up — especially professionals on higher salaries.

Here's the critical difference the KNM tests:

| | Sociale Huur | Vrije Sector |
|---|---|---|
| **Monthly rent** | Up to ~€879.66 | Above ~€879.66 (no cap) |
| **Income limit** | Yes (~€44,035 single) | No |
| **Managed by** | Woningcorporaties | Private landlords/agencies |
| **Waiting list** | Yes — years in most cities | No formal waiting list |
| **Rent increase cap** | Government-regulated | Negotiated in contract |
| **Huurtoeslag eligible** | Usually yes | No |
| **Huurcommissie access** | Yes (full) | Limited |

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Don't skip this:</strong> The waiting list for social housing in Amsterdam averages <strong>13+ years</strong>. In smaller cities it's shorter, but still years — not months. Most expat professionals won't qualify for social housing based on income anyway, but the KNM expects you to understand how the system works.</div>

## Tenant Rights: Huurbescherming

Dutch tenant protection (huurbescherming) is among the strongest in the world. Once you have a rental contract, your landlord can't simply end it. This applies to both social and private housing, though the specifics differ.

**Your core rights as a tenant:**

- **Right to stay.** Your landlord cannot terminate your lease just because they want to. They need a legally valid reason (like personal use of the property, major renovation, or consistent late payment). Even then, they have to go through the courts.
- **Rent protection.** In social housing, rent increases are capped annually by the government. In the private sector, your contract determines the terms — but unreasonable increases can be challenged.
- **Right to maintenance.** Your landlord must keep the property in good condition. Structural issues, heating problems, plumbing — that's their responsibility. If they refuse, you can involve the huurcommissie.
- **Privacy.** Your landlord cannot enter the property without your permission except in genuine emergencies.
- **No illegal surcharges.** Key money (sleutelgeld) is illegal in the Netherlands. If a landlord or agent demands an upfront fee beyond the legal deposit and first month's rent, that's against the law.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key point for KNM:</strong> Dutch tenants have the right to remain in their rental property even if the landlord wants to sell it. The sale of a property does not end an existing lease — the new owner inherits the tenant and the contract. "Koop breekt geen huur" (purchase doesn't break rental) is a fundamental principle.</div>

## The Huurcommissie: Your Rent Tribunal

The huurcommissie (rent tribunal) is a government-backed organization that resolves disputes between tenants and landlords. Think of it as an accessible, low-cost arbitration service specifically for housing issues.

**What the huurcommissie handles:**

- Disputes about rent amounts (is your rent too high for what you're getting?)
- Disagreements about service costs (servicekosten)
- Maintenance complaints when your landlord won't act
- Disputes about the property's condition at move-in or move-out
- Challenges to rent increases

**How to use it:** You file a request online or by mail, pay a small fee (around **€25** for tenants), and the huurcommissie sends an inspector to assess the situation. They issue a binding ruling in most cases.

Here's something many expats don't realize: the huurcommissie uses a **points system** (puntensysteem/woningwaarderingsstelsel) to determine the maximum fair rent for a property. They assess factors like square footage, number of rooms, energy label, outdoor space, and location. If your rent exceeds the maximum points value and your property falls in the social housing range, the huurcommissie can **force your landlord to lower the rent**.

For private sector rentals (above the liberalization threshold), the huurcommissie's powers are more limited — they can mainly assess the initial rent within the first six months and handle service cost disputes.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Exam tip:</strong> The KNM specifically tests whether you know the huurcommissie exists and what it does. You don't need to memorize the points formula, but you do need to know it's a resource for tenants who have disputes with their landlord.</div>

## Registering Your Address: BRP Registration

When you move to a new address in the Netherlands — whether it's your first address or your tenth — you are **legally required** to register at the gemeente (municipality). This isn't optional. It's the law.

You register at the Basisregistratie Personen (BRP), which is the municipal personal records database. You need to do this **within 5 days** of moving to a new address.

**Why it matters beyond the law:**

- Your address registration is linked to your BSN (citizen service number)
- You need it for health insurance, toeslagen (allowances), voting, and tax
- Your landlord must allow you to register at the rental address — it's illegal for a landlord to prevent this
- An incorrect registration can cause problems with your residence permit

**What happens if you don't register?** The gemeente can fine you. But more practically, without proper registration you can't access government services, you won't receive official mail, and it can create complications with your IND (immigration) status.

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Red flag:</strong> If a landlord tells you that you can't register at their property, walk away. This usually means the property isn't legally rented out, or there's something else wrong. Registration is your legal right as a tenant.</div>

## Huurtoeslag: Rent Subsidy

Huurtoeslag is a monthly rent subsidy from the Belastingdienst (tax authority) to help people with lower incomes afford their housing. Spoiler: most expat professionals won't qualify because of income limits. But the KNM tests it heavily, so you need to understand how it works.

**Eligibility requirements (all must be met):**

- You're **18 or older**
- You rent an **independent dwelling** (self-contained, with own front door, kitchen, and bathroom)
- Your rent is below the **maximum rent threshold** (~€879.66 in 2026)
- Your income and assets fall below set limits
- You're registered at the address in the BRP
- You have Dutch nationality or a valid residence permit

The amount you receive depends on your income, rent, and household composition. It's applied for through the Belastingdienst (MijnToeslagen portal), and it's paid monthly directly to your bank account.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">~1.4 million</div><div class="stat-label">Households in the Netherlands receive huurtoeslag — making it one of the largest subsidy programs in the country</div></div>

**What KNM tests:** You don't need to calculate huurtoeslag amounts. But you do need to know it exists, who it's for (lower-income tenants in social housing), and that it comes from the Belastingdienst — not from your landlord or housing association.

## Buying vs. Renting, Utilities, and VvE

If you're planning to stay in the Netherlands long-term, buying a home is worth considering. The Dutch mortgage system is surprisingly accessible for expats — and mortgage interest is tax-deductible (hypotheekrenteaftrek), which is a significant financial benefit.

**Key things about buying:**

- You'll need a mortgage advisor (hypotheekadviseur) and a notaris to handle the legal transfer
- The maximum mortgage is roughly **100% of the property value** (no more than the taxable value in most cases)
- Overdrachtsbelasting (transfer tax) is **2%** for residential property (with exemptions for first-time buyers under 35)
- If you buy an apartment, you'll likely become part of a **VvE (Vereniging van Eigenaren)** — a homeowner association that manages shared spaces, building maintenance, and communal decisions. Monthly VvE contributions are mandatory.

**About utilities and service costs:**

When renting, your monthly costs go beyond just rent. You'll typically pay separately for:

- Gas, electricity, and water (via energy providers like Vattenfall, Eneco, etc.)
- Internet and TV
- Municipal taxes (gemeentelijke belastingen) — water board tax and waste tax
- Service costs (servicekosten) if your building has shared amenities — cleaning, elevator maintenance, garden upkeep

Service costs are charged on top of rent and should be itemized annually by your landlord. If they seem unreasonably high, the huurcommissie can review them.

## What the KNM Specifically Tests on Housing

The housing section of the KNM isn't trying to make you a real estate expert. It's testing whether you understand the basics of how housing works in the Netherlands — the kind of knowledge you'd need to find a place, protect your rights, and deal with problems.

**Expect questions on:**

- The **difference between social housing and private rental** — who qualifies, how each works
- **Tenant rights** — knowing that landlords can't easily evict you, that maintenance is their responsibility
- The **huurcommissie** — what it is, when to use it
- **Registering your address** at the gemeente — that it's mandatory and must happen quickly
- **Huurtoeslag** — who qualifies, where to apply
- The **role of woningcorporaties** in managing social housing

You won't be asked to calculate rent points or walk through a mortgage application. The questions focus on rights, responsibilities, and knowing which organizations handle what.

**Practice these topics** with actual KNM-style questions in our [KNM practice module](/learn/knm) — the housing section maps directly to what you'll see on exam day.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can my landlord raise the rent whenever they want?

No. In social housing, rent increases are capped by the government and happen once per year (typically July 1). In private sector rentals, the contract determines when and how much rent can increase. Even in the private sector, a sudden massive increase can be challenged — especially if it wasn't specified in the contract. Your landlord must give proper written notice before any increase.

### What should I do if my landlord refuses to fix something?

Start by putting your request in writing (email counts). Give your landlord a reasonable deadline. If they still don't act, you can file a complaint with the **huurcommissie**. They'll send an inspector to assess the issue and can order your landlord to make repairs. For urgent issues (no heating in winter, flooding), the gemeente may also be able to intervene.

### Do I need to register at the gemeente every time I move?

Yes. Every time you change your address within the Netherlands, you must register your new address at the gemeente within **5 days**. You can often do this online through your municipality's website or the MijnOverheid portal. If you're moving to a different municipality, you register at the new gemeente — they'll handle the deregistration from your old one.

### Can a landlord refuse to rent to me because I'm an expat?

Discrimination in housing is illegal under Dutch law. A landlord cannot refuse you based on nationality, ethnicity, religion, or similar grounds. They *can* set requirements around income (usually 3x monthly rent in gross salary) and may ask for an employment contract. If you believe you've been discriminated against, you can file a complaint with the College voor de Rechten van de Mens (Netherlands Institute for Human Rights).

### Is renting through an agency (makelaar) safe?

Generally yes, but check that the agency is registered with a professional organization like **NVM**, **VBO**, or **VastgoedPRO**. These memberships mean the agency follows a code of conduct. Be cautious of agencies that demand large upfront payments — agent fees for rentals were banned in 2016 for tenants. The landlord pays the agent, not you.
