# Inburgering Deadlines, Fines & Extensions: What Happens If You're Late

If you're required to pass inburgering, you have a deadline — and missing it can cost you up to **€1,250 in fines** and put your residence permit at risk. The deadline depends on which law applies to you (Wi2013 or Wi2021), and the extension process has specific requirements that most people don't know about until it's almost too late.

Here's the good news: the system does allow extensions. The Dutch government recognizes that life happens — medical issues, personal circumstances, exam failures despite genuine effort. But you have to ask for it the right way, at the right time. Waiting until after your deadline has passed to figure this out is a problem you don't want.

This guide breaks down exactly how deadlines work, what the consequences are, and how to protect yourself.

## Who Has a Deadline (and Who Doesn't)

Not everyone doing inburgering is on the clock. This distinction matters a lot, and mixing it up is one of the most common mistakes we see.

**You HAVE a mandatory deadline if:**

- You're the spouse or partner of a kennismigrant, living in the Netherlands on a dependent visa
- You moved to the Netherlands for family reunification
- You're a non-EU citizen with a residence permit that includes an inburgering requirement
- You're an asylum status holder (under Wi2021, the municipality sets your plan)

**You do NOT have a deadline if:**

- You're a kennismigrant doing inburgering voluntarily (for PR or citizenship)
- You're an EU/EEA/Swiss national
- You're exempt from inburgering (see our [exemptions guide](/blog/inburgering-exemptions-guide))

<div class="warning-box"><strong>This trips up couples constantly:</strong> If you're a kennismigrant, you have no inburgering obligation or deadline. But your spouse or partner who joined you on a dependent visa almost certainly does. Their deadline is real, the fines are real, and it has nothing to do with your status. Make sure you both know where you stand.</div>

## How Your Deadline Is Determined

Your deadline depends on which inburgering law (wet inburgering) applies to you. The dividing line is **January 1, 2022**.

### Under Wi2013 (arrived or became inburgering-plichtig before January 1, 2022)

Your inburgering deadline is **3 years** from the date your inburgering obligation officially started. That start date is in the letter DUO sent you confirming your obligation — not the date you arrived in the Netherlands, and not the date you registered at the gemeente. These can all be different dates.

DUO manages your entire process. They send your deadline notification, track your progress, and handle extension requests.

### Under Wi2021 (arrived or became inburgering-plichtig on or after January 1, 2022)

Your deadline is set by your **gemeente (municipality)**, not DUO. Under the new law, municipalities play a much larger role. They create a personal inburgering plan (PIP) for you, which includes your deadline.

The standard deadline under Wi2021 is also **3 years**, but your municipality can adjust this based on your personal plan. They assess your starting level, personal circumstances, and learning route before setting a target date.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Critical difference:</strong> Under Wi2013, DUO handles everything. Under Wi2021, your municipality handles your plan and deadline, while DUO still handles exam registration and results. Know which law applies to you — it determines who you contact about everything. Check our <a href="/blog/wi2013-vs-wi2021-which-rules-apply">Wi2013 vs Wi2021 guide</a> to figure this out.</div>

## The Timeline: What Happens at Each Stage

Here's a typical timeline for someone under Wi2013. Under Wi2021, the stages are similar but the municipality replaces DUO for planning and extensions.

**Year 1-2: Active study period**

- You receive your inburgering obligation letter from DUO with your official start date and deadline
- You begin studying and taking exams
- DUO tracks which exams you've passed via the Mijn Inburgering portal

**6 months before deadline: First warning**

- DUO sends a reminder that your deadline is approaching
- This is your signal to either finish up or start an extension request
- If you haven't passed all components, don't wait — act now

**3 months before deadline: Final warning**

- DUO sends a second notification
- If you haven't requested an extension yet and you're not going to make it, file the request immediately

**Deadline passes without completion:**

- DUO assesses whether you've made sufficient effort
- If you haven't: a fine is issued
- Your deadline may be extended with a new fine threat

**After the fine:**

- You receive a new deadline (typically 2 years)
- If you miss that one too: another fine
- This cycle can repeat, with fines accumulating

## Fines: How Much and How They Work

Let's be specific about what you're facing.

**The fine amount:** Up to **€1,250** per missed deadline. The exact amount depends on your circumstances and whether DUO determines you made "sufficient effort" (voldoende inspanning) to pass on time.

**How "sufficient effort" is assessed:**

DUO looks at several factors:

- Did you register for exams and actually show up?
- Did you attend language courses?
- How many exam components have you already passed?
- Were there legitimate obstacles (medical, personal)?

If DUO concludes you didn't try hard enough — say you registered for zero exams and took no courses over three years — you'll get the full fine. If you passed 4 out of 6 components and failed the last two despite multiple attempts, DUO is more likely to be lenient.

**What fines affect beyond your wallet:**

- **Residence permit renewal.** The IND (immigration service) checks your inburgering status when you apply to extend your residence permit. An overdue inburgering obligation can complicate the renewal process. In serious cases (zero effort, repeated fines), it could lead to a denial.
- **PR and citizenship applications.** You can't apply for permanent residence or Dutch citizenship without your inburgeringsdiploma. Outstanding fines and an incomplete obligation are a hard stop.
- **Your record with DUO.** Fines are registered and tracked. They show up when you interact with government services related to your integration status.

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Don't ignore DUO letters.</strong> If you receive a letter about your deadline or a fine, respond. Ignoring correspondence doesn't make the obligation go away — it makes the situation worse. If you can't read the Dutch letter, get it translated or call DUO's multilingual helpline.</div>

## How to Request an Extension (Verlenging)

You can request an extension before your deadline arrives. This is the right move if you're making genuine effort but won't finish in time. Don't wait until the deadline has passed.

**Valid reasons for an extension:**

- **Medical issues** — documented illness, surgery, or mental health conditions that prevented you from studying or taking exams. You'll need a doctor's statement.
- **Demonstrable effort** — you've been taking courses, sitting exams, and making progress, but haven't cleared all components yet. Exam receipts and course certificates help here.
- **Personal circumstances** — pregnancy, caregiving responsibilities, divorce, death in the family, or other life events that significantly disrupted your ability to study.
- **Exam availability issues** — in rare cases, if exam slots weren't available in your region within a reasonable timeframe.

**How to file for an extension:**

Under **Wi2013:** Submit your extension request to DUO via the Mijn Inburgering portal or by mail. Include supporting documentation (medical statements, exam results, course enrollment proof). DUO reviews it and responds in writing.

Under **Wi2021:** Contact your **gemeente** — they manage your PIP (personal inburgering plan) and can adjust your deadline. The process varies by municipality, so call them directly or check their website.

**When to file:** At least **3 months before your deadline**. Filing last-minute reduces your chances and leaves no time to fix problems with your application.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Document everything from day one.</strong> Keep every course enrollment confirmation, exam receipt, DUO letter, and tutor invoice. If you ever need to prove you've been making genuine effort, this paper trail is what saves you. A folder on your computer or a physical binder — whatever works. Just do it.</div>

## How to Check Your Deadline

You can check your current deadline, exam results, and overall progress through the **Mijn Inburgering** portal at [inburgeren.nl](https://inburgeren.nl). You'll need your DigiD to log in.

**What you'll find there:**

- Your official deadline date
- Which exam components you've passed and which are still open
- Any extensions that have been granted
- Letters DUO has sent you

If you're under **Wi2021**, your municipality also has information about your personal plan. Some municipalities have their own portal or assign a case manager you can contact directly.

**Don't have DigiD yet?** You need it for almost everything related to inburgering — exam registration, checking results, requesting extensions. Apply for it early at [digid.nl](https://digid.nl). It takes about a week to receive your activation code by mail.

## Voluntary Inburgering: No Deadline, But Don't Drag It Out

If you're a kennismigrant doing inburgering voluntarily — because you want permanent residence or citizenship — there's no official deadline and no fine risk. That's the good news.

The not-so-good news: without a deadline, it's very easy to keep postponing. And every year you wait is a year you could have had PR or Dutch citizenship.

There's also a practical consideration. Exam formats change. The [KNM exam was completely overhauled in July 2025](/blog/knm-exam-2026-new-format). Study materials become outdated. The longer you wait, the more likely you'll need to re-learn things because the rules or format shifted.

Set your own deadline. Treat it like a work project with a delivery date. Our [30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) is designed for exactly this — professionals who want structure without a government mandate breathing down their neck.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I pay the fine and still avoid doing inburgering?

No. Paying the fine doesn't cancel your inburgering obligation. You'll get a new deadline after the fine, and if you miss that one, you'll be fined again. The obligation only ends when you pass all required components and receive your inburgeringsdiploma — or when you qualify for an exemption. The fine is a penalty, not a buyout.

### What if I passed some exams but not all before my deadline?

DUO takes your progress into account. If you've passed most components and have been actively trying, you're more likely to receive a reduced fine or a straightforward extension rather than the maximum penalty. The key is demonstrating effort — exam registrations, course attendance, and passed components all count in your favor.

### My spouse has a deadline but I don't. Can their deadline affect my visa?

Your spouse's inburgering obligation is separate from yours. Their missed deadline and any resulting fines apply to them, not you. But here's the indirect risk: if their residence permit renewal gets complicated because of unmet inburgering requirements, it could affect your household situation depending on the visa type. Make sure your spouse stays on top of their own deadlines.

### How long is an extension typically?

Extensions under Wi2013 are usually **2 years**. Under Wi2021, the municipality determines the length based on your personal situation and plan. In both cases, the extension comes with its own new deadline — miss that one, and the cycle repeats.

### Can I appeal a fine?

Yes. You can file an objection (bezwaar) with DUO within **6 weeks** of receiving the fine. State your grounds — medical issues, extenuating circumstances, or procedural errors. If DUO rejects your objection, you can escalate to the administrative court (bestuursrechter). Getting legal advice before appealing is a good idea, especially if the amount is significant.
