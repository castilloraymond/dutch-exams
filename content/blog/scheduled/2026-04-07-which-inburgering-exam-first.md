# Which Inburgering Exam Should You Take First?

Start with **KNM** (Knowledge of Dutch Society). It's pure factual knowledge, requires no language production, and gives you a confidence-boosting pass before the harder exams. After that, work through the language components from passive skills (reading, listening) to active ones (writing, speaking) — and do ONA in parallel since it's a portfolio, not a timed test.

That's the short version. But the right order depends on your specific strengths, your Dutch level, and how much time you've got. Let's break it down.

## Why Exam Order Actually Matters

You can take the six inburgering components in any sequence you want. DUO doesn't care. There's no prerequisite chain, no forced path. You book each exam separately through the [Mijn Inburgering portal](https://inburgeren.nl), and you could theoretically schedule all six on consecutive days if the slots are available.

But just because you *can* doesn't mean you *should*.

Here's the thing — each pass builds psychological momentum. Failing your first exam is demoralizing. It costs you another **€50** and weeks of waiting for the next available slot. Starting with something you're likely to pass means you walk into exam two already feeling like someone who passes exams.

<div class="takeaway-box">The goal isn't just to pass all six components. It's to pass them efficiently — with as few retakes and as little wasted time as possible.</div>

## The Recommended Order for Most Professionals

This sequence works for the majority of expats and professionals. It moves from lowest-risk to highest-risk, building skills and confidence along the way.

| Order | Exam | Why This Position |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | KNM (Society Knowledge) | No Dutch production required. Study facts, pass a multiple-choice test. Quick win. |
| **2** | Lezen (Reading) | Passive skill. Professionals who read Dutch emails and signs already have a head start. |
| **3** | Luisteren (Listening) | Passive skill, but faster-paced. Benefits from the reading vocab you just studied. |
| **4** | Schrijven (Writing) | Active production, but structured — emails, forms, short messages with predictable formats. |
| **5** | Spreken (Speaking) | Most anxiety-inducing. By now you've built Dutch confidence from four passes. |
| **6** | ONA (Career Orientation) | Portfolio-based. Work on it in parallel from the start — submit when ready. |

<div class="tip-box">ONA is the exception to the sequence. It's not a timed exam — it's a portfolio you build over weeks or months. Start it alongside your first exam and chip away at it between study sessions. By the time you've passed the other five, your ONA portfolio should be ready to submit.</div>

## Breaking Down Each Component

### KNM — The Confidence Builder

**40 questions, 45 minutes, pass mark 28/40 (70%).**

KNM tests whether you know how Dutch society works — the healthcare system, political structure, education, work culture, values. It's entirely in Dutch, but the questions are straightforward multiple-choice. No writing. No speaking. No listening to audio clips.

For professionals who've been living in the Netherlands for a year or more, you already know a surprising amount of this material. You've been to the huisarts. You've dealt with the Belastingdienst. You've probably had a conversation about Zwarte Piet.

The exam was [completely redesigned in July 2025](/blog/knm-exam-2026-new-format), so make sure you're studying the new format — not the old video-based scenarios.

Study time: **2-3 weeks** of focused prep for most people.

### Lezen — Your Strongest Passive Skill

**~25 questions, 65 minutes, pass mark ~60%.**

Reading is usually the strongest skill for professionals. You've been reading Dutch bus signs, supermarket labels, and gemeente letters since you arrived. The exam tests practical texts — ads, emails, notices, short articles — at A2 level.

The [full breakdown of the Lezen format](/blog/lezen-reading-exam-format-scoring) covers question types and strategies. But the key insight: 65 minutes for 25 questions is generous. Most prepared candidates finish with time to spare.

Study time: **2-3 weeks** if you read Dutch semi-regularly. Longer if you've been living entirely in English.

### Luisteren — Passive but Faster

**~25 questions, 45 minutes, pass mark ~60%.**

Listening is harder than reading for most people — audio moves at its own pace, and you can't re-read a sentence. But it's still a passive skill. You're choosing from multiple-choice options, not producing Dutch yourself.

The [Luisteren exam guide](/blog/luisteren-exam-format-scoring) has the full format details. One thing to know: audio clips play **twice**. Use the first listen for the general idea, second listen for specific answers.

Study time: **3-4 weeks**. Watch Dutch TV with subtitles. Listen to NOS Journaal in Makkelijke Taal.

### Schrijven — Structured Production

**4 tasks, 35 minutes, human-graded.**

Writing is your first "active" exam — you're producing Dutch, not just recognizing it. But the format is predictable. You'll write short emails, fill out forms, and compose brief messages. Every task follows a clear template.

The [Schrijven exam guide](/blog/schrijven-writing-exam-guide) covers each task type. Spoiler alert: memorizing email openings, closings, and common phrases gets you 80% of the way there.

Study time: **3-4 weeks** of deliberate practice. Write something every day, even if it's just a fake email.

### Spreken — Save This for Last

**2 parts, ~15 minutes, human-graded.**

Speaking is where most people's anxiety peaks. You're sitting in front of a computer, recording yourself answering Dutch prompts. No human conversation partner to help you along. No body language cues.

By scheduling Spreken last, you've already passed four exams. You've read Dutch, listened to Dutch, and written Dutch under exam conditions. Your brain has been processing the language for months. That accumulated exposure makes a real difference when you open your mouth.

The [Spreken exam format guide](/blog/spreken-speaking-exam-new-format-2025) covers the new format in detail.

Study time: **4-6 weeks**. Practice speaking out loud daily — narrate your commute, describe your day, respond to prompts.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">6</div><div class="stat-label">Total components — but you only need to actively study for 5. ONA is a portfolio built over time.</div></div>

## When Should You Adjust This Order?

The recommended sequence isn't gospel. Swap things around based on your situation.

**If your spoken Dutch is actually your strongest skill** (maybe your partner is Dutch, or you work in a Dutch-speaking team), move Spreken earlier. Don't save your best skill for last — use it to rack up an early win.

**If you struggle with reading** because your Dutch vocabulary is limited, consider doing Luisteren before Lezen. Some people find it easier to understand spoken Dutch (through context and tone) than written Dutch (where you're staring at unfamiliar words).

**If you have a deadline approaching**, prioritize the exams you're most likely to pass *right now*. Every passed component is one fewer thing to worry about. Failing an exam you weren't ready for wastes 6-8 weeks (retake wait time plus re-study).

**If your KNM knowledge is weak** because you just arrived in the Netherlands, start with Lezen or Luisteren instead. KNM requires specific factual knowledge that takes time to absorb — rushing it leads to a frustrating 25/40.

## Booking Strategy: Think Ahead

DUO exam slots fill up fast, especially in the Randstad (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht). Here's what catches people off guard.

**Book 2-3 months in advance.** Popular locations and morning slots disappear quickly. If you wait until you feel "ready," you might not get a slot for weeks.

**Stagger your bookings.** Don't book all six at once. Book your first exam, then schedule the second one about 4-6 weeks later. That gives you time to study for the next component while waiting for results from the previous one.

**Know the retake rules.** If you fail, you need to wait a minimum period before rebooking (typically a few weeks). You'll pay another **€50** per attempt. Factor this into your timeline — assume you might need one retake and build buffer into your schedule.

<div class="warning-box">Exam results take about 8 weeks to arrive by post. Don't wait for official results before studying for your next component — start prep immediately after taking each exam.</div>

**Consider location flexibility.** If Amsterdam is fully booked, check Leiden, Haarlem, or even Eindhoven. The exam is identical everywhere. A 45-minute train ride beats waiting an extra month.

## Total Timeline: Registration to Diploma

Here's a realistic timeline for a professional studying part-time (1-2 hours per day, more on weekends):

| Phase | Duration | What You're Doing |
|---|---|---|
| **Prep start** | Week 1 | Start ONA portfolio + begin KNM study |
| **KNM exam** | Week 3-4 | Take KNM. Begin Lezen study. |
| **Lezen exam** | Week 7-8 | Take Lezen. Begin Luisteren study. |
| **Luisteren exam** | Week 11-12 | Take Luisteren. Begin Schrijven study. |
| **Schrijven exam** | Week 15-16 | Take Schrijven. Begin Spreken practice. |
| **Spreken exam** | Week 19-20 | Take Spreken. Finalize ONA portfolio. |
| **ONA submission** | Week 20-22 | Submit completed ONA portfolio. |
| **Results arrive** | Week 28-30 | All results in. Apply for diploma. |

That's roughly **7-8 months** from start to finish. Some people do it faster — the [30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) covers an aggressive timeline. Some take a year. The point is having a plan, not rushing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I take multiple exams on the same day?

Technically yes, if slots are available. But it's not a great idea. Exam fatigue is real, and each test requires a different type of mental focus. Spacing them out gives you time to recover and refocus. One exam per visit is the sweet spot.

### What happens if I fail one component?

You rebook it, pay another ~€50, and take it again. There's no limit on retakes. Your passes on other components still count — you don't lose them. Just address why you failed (not enough vocab? time management? anxiety?) and adjust your prep.

### Does the order I pass them in affect my diploma?

No. DUO doesn't care about sequence. Pass all six components in any order, and you get your inburgeringsdiploma. The diploma itself doesn't mention dates or order — it just confirms you passed everything.

### Should I study for multiple exams simultaneously?

You can, but focused single-exam prep is more effective. The exception is ONA (work on it in parallel) and KNM (the factual knowledge you learn there helps with context for reading and listening texts). Trying to split your study time across Schrijven and Spreken simultaneously usually means mediocre prep for both.

### How do I know which exam is my strongest?

Take a quick diagnostic. Try [our free quick assessment](/try) — it covers Lezen, Luisteren, and KNM in about 10 minutes each. Your scores will show you exactly where you're strongest and where you need the most work.

*Passing six exams sounds like a lot. It is. But with the right sequence, each one builds on the last, and by the time you're sitting for Spreken, you've already proven to yourself five times over that you can do this. [Start with a quick assessment](/try) to see where you stand — then plan your order from there.*
