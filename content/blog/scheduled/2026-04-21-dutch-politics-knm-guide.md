# Dutch Politics: What KNM Tests You On

The KNM exam expects you to know the basics of how the Netherlands is governed — the role of the King, how parliament works, what happens during elections, and how decisions get made at national and local levels. You don't need to become a political scientist. You need to know the structure, the key institutions, and a handful of specific facts.

This is one of the highest-yield KNM topics. Political questions show up on virtually every exam, and the facts are concrete and memorizable. Once you've got them down, these are free points.

## The Dutch Government: A Quick Map

Before we get into details, here's the full structure at a glance. Refer back to this as you read.

| Level | Institution | Key Facts |
|---|---|---|
| **Head of State** | King Willem-Alexander | Ceremonial role. Signs laws. Opens parliament annually on Prinsjesdag. |
| **Head of Government** | Minister-President (Prime Minister) | Leads the cabinet. Currently the leader of the largest coalition party. |
| **Parliament (upper)** | Eerste Kamer (Senate) | 75 members. Elected indirectly by provincial councils. Can approve or reject laws — cannot amend them. |
| **Parliament (lower)** | Tweede Kamer (House of Representatives) | 150 members. Directly elected by citizens. Proposes and debates laws. |
| **Executive** | Cabinet (ministerraad) | Ministers + Prime Minister. Runs the country day-to-day. |
| **Provincial** | 12 Provinces | Each has a provincial council (Provinciale Staten) and a King's Commissioner. |
| **Local** | 342 Municipalities (gemeenten) | Run by a mayor (burgemeester) and municipal council (gemeenteraad). |

<div class="takeaway-box">The KNM tests structure, not opinion. You need to know what each institution does and how it connects to the others — not which party is "best" or what current policy debates are about.</div>

## The Monarchy: What You Need to Know

The Netherlands is a **constitutional monarchy**. King Willem-Alexander has been the head of state since 2013, when his mother Queen Beatrix abdicated. His wife, Queen Máxima, has a ceremonial role alongside him.

Here's what the King actually does:

- **Signs all new laws.** A law isn't official until the King signs it. But this is a formality — he doesn't have veto power in practice.
- **Opens parliament every year on Prinsjesdag** (the third Tuesday of September). The King reads the *Troonrede* (Speech from the Throne) outlining the government's plans for the coming year. He rides in a golden coach. It's a whole thing.
- **Appoints a *formateur*** after elections to form a new government. This is constitutionally significant — the King plays a role in the coalition formation process.
- **Represents the Netherlands internationally** at state visits and diplomatic events.

What the King does NOT do: make policy, vote on laws, run the government, or interfere in daily politics. The Netherlands is a democracy. The King is the symbol, not the decision-maker.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">2013</div><div class="stat-label">Year Willem-Alexander became King after Queen Beatrix abdicated</div></div>

**KNM exam angle:** Expect questions about the King's role on Prinsjesdag, the fact that the Netherlands is a constitutional monarchy, and the difference between the King's ceremonial power and the government's actual power.

## Parliament: Eerste Kamer and Tweede Kamer

The Dutch parliament is called the **Staten-Generaal** and has two chambers. This is where laws get made (or blocked).

### Tweede Kamer (House of Representatives)

This is the main chamber. The one that matters most in day-to-day politics.

- **150 seats**, directly elected by Dutch citizens every 4 years (or sooner, if the government falls)
- Members are called *Kamerleden*
- The Tweede Kamer **proposes, debates, and amends** legislation
- Has the right to ask ministers questions (*interpellatierecht*), investigate government actions, and propose motions of no confidence
- Elections use **proportional representation** — every vote counts equally, no districts

The leader of the largest party (or the largest coalition partner) typically becomes Prime Minister and forms a cabinet. But this isn't automatic — it depends on coalition negotiations.

### Eerste Kamer (Senate)

The upper chamber. Less visible, but still important.

- **75 seats**, elected indirectly by members of the provincial councils (*Provinciale Staten*)
- The Eerste Kamer can **approve or reject** laws passed by the Tweede Kamer
- It **cannot amend** laws — only accept or block them entirely
- Senators serve part-time. Most have other jobs. Meetings are typically on Tuesdays.

<div class="tip-box">KNM loves to test the difference between the two chambers. Remember: Tweede Kamer = 150 seats, direct elections, can amend laws. Eerste Kamer = 75 seats, indirect elections, can only say yes or no.</div>

## The Cabinet and Prime Minister

After Tweede Kamer elections, a new cabinet must be formed. This process — *kabinetsformatie* — is famously slow. Coalition negotiations in the Netherlands regularly take 3-6 months. The record was over 200 days.

The **Prime Minister** (*Minister-President*) chairs the cabinet and is the head of government. The cabinet consists of ministers, each responsible for a policy area (health, education, finance, defense, etc.). Some ministers also have state secretaries (*staatssecretarissen*) who handle specific parts of their portfolio.

Important for the KNM:
- **The Prime Minister is NOT directly elected.** Dutch citizens vote for parties, not for a PM candidate. The PM emerges from coalition negotiations.
- **Cabinet ministers cannot be members of parliament.** If an MP becomes a minister, they must give up their parliamentary seat.
- **The government must have the confidence of the Tweede Kamer.** If a majority votes no-confidence, the cabinet falls and new elections may follow.

## Coalition Government: Why the Netherlands Always Has One

Here's something that surprises a lot of expats coming from countries with two dominant parties: the Netherlands has never had a single-party government. Not once in modern history.

Dutch elections use **proportional representation** with no electoral threshold (well, technically you need enough votes for one seat, which is about 0.67% of the total). This means a lot of parties win seats. A typical Tweede Kamer has **13-17 different parties** represented.

No single party comes close to 75 seats (the majority). So parties must negotiate coalitions — typically 3-4 parties joining forces to form a government with a combined majority.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">13-17</div><div class="stat-label">Political parties typically represented in the Tweede Kamer after elections</div></div>

**What this means in practice:**
- Coalition agreements are detailed documents where parties compromise on policy
- Coalition negotiations can take months
- Governments sometimes fall mid-term when coalition partners disagree on major issues
- Dutch politics values consensus and compromise — *polderen* (the polder model)

**KNM exam angle:** You may get questions about why the Netherlands has coalition governments (proportional representation, many parties, no single majority) and what happens when a coalition collapses.

## Elections and Voting

Dutch citizens aged 18 and older can vote. As an expat without Dutch citizenship, you **cannot vote in national elections** (Tweede Kamer) — but you **can vote in municipal elections** (*gemeenteraadsverkiezingen*) if you've been a legal resident for at least 5 years.

Key election facts:

- **Tweede Kamer elections:** every 4 years, or earlier if the government falls. Proportional representation. You vote for a party list. Preferential votes (*voorkeurstemmen*) can boost individual candidates on the list.
- **Provincial elections:** every 4 years. Provincial council members then elect the Eerste Kamer.
- **Municipal elections:** every 4 years. This is where non-Dutch residents (5+ years) can participate.
- **European Parliament elections:** every 5 years. EU citizens can vote.
- **Voting is NOT mandatory** in the Netherlands. It used to be (until 1970), but not anymore.

<div class="takeaway-box">For the KNM exam, remember three things about elections: proportional representation, voting age is 18, and voting is not mandatory.</div>

## Provinces and Municipalities: Local Government

The Netherlands has **12 provinces** — you live in one of them. Provinces handle things like spatial planning, environmental policy, and regional transport. Each province has:

- A **Provinciale Staten** (provincial council) — elected directly by residents
- A **Commissaris van de Koning** (King's Commissioner) — appointed by the national government

But for daily life, **your municipality (gemeente) matters more than your province.** Municipalities handle:

- Civil registration (BRP — where you register your address)
- Waste collection and local infrastructure
- Social services and welfare (bijstand)
- Building permits
- Public order (via the mayor)
- Local education oversight

The **burgemeester (mayor)** is NOT elected by citizens. The mayor is appointed by the national government (on recommendation of the municipal council). This is a distinctly Dutch quirk — most countries elect their mayors.

The **gemeenteraad (municipal council)** IS elected by residents, including non-Dutch residents who've lived in the Netherlands for 5+ years.

<div class="tip-box">The KNM frequently tests municipality responsibilities. If a question asks "who handles waste collection / civil registration / social services?" — the answer is almost always the gemeente.</div>

## How Laws Are Made

The KNM may ask about the legislative process. Here's the simplified version:

1. **A bill is proposed** — usually by the cabinet, but Tweede Kamer members can also introduce bills (*initiatiefwet*)
2. **The Tweede Kamer debates and votes.** They can amend the bill. Majority vote (76+ of 150) needed to pass.
3. **The Eerste Kamer reviews and votes.** They cannot change the bill — only approve or reject. Majority (38+ of 75) needed.
4. **The King signs the law** and it's published in the *Staatsblad* (official gazette).
5. **The law takes effect** on the specified date.

The whole process can take weeks or years depending on the topic. Controversial bills get stuck. Routine laws pass quickly. The system is designed for deliberation, not speed.

## Major Political Parties (What the KNM Expects)

The KNM doesn't ask you to pick a favorite party. It tests whether you understand that the Netherlands has a multi-party system with parties across the political spectrum.

You don't need to memorize party platforms. But knowing the general landscape helps with context questions:

| Party | Position | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| VVD | Center-right / Liberal | Traditionally the largest party in recent decades |
| PVV | Right / Populist | Anti-immigration, Eurosceptic |
| NSC | Center / New Social Contract | Founded 2023 by Pieter Omtzigt |
| GL-PvdA | Center-left / Green-Labour | Merger of GroenLinks and PvdA |
| D66 | Center / Progressive liberal | Pro-EU, pro-education |
| CDA | Center-right / Christian democratic | Historically a major coalition partner |
| SP | Left / Socialist | Social justice focus |
| PvdD | Left / Animal rights | Unique single-issue party |
| BBB | Center-right / Farmers' party | Emerged 2023, strong in provincial politics |

**KNM exam angle:** The exam cares about the *system*, not current events. Expect questions like: "How many seats in the Tweede Kamer?" (150), "Is the Netherlands a republic or a monarchy?" (monarchy), "Who signs laws?" (the King). Not "Which party won the last election?"

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to know current Dutch politics for the KNM?

No. The KNM tests structural knowledge — how the system works, not who's currently in power. You won't get questions about specific government policies or recent political events. Focus on institutions, roles, and processes.

### How many political questions appear on the KNM exam?

The exam has **40 questions across 8 topics**. Politics falls under the broader "Politiek en democratie" category. Expect roughly **4-6 questions** directly about political structure, elections, and government roles. Other questions about municipality services or citizen rights overlap with this material.

### Can I vote in Dutch elections as an expat?

It depends. For **national elections** (Tweede Kamer): no, not unless you have Dutch citizenship. For **municipal elections**: yes, if you've been a legal resident for at least 5 years. For **European Parliament elections**: yes, if you're an EU citizen. The KNM expects you to know these distinctions.

### What's the difference between the government and parliament?

Parliament (Staten-Generaal) makes the laws. The government (cabinet) executes them. Parliament consists of elected representatives who debate and vote. The cabinet consists of ministers who run ministries and implement policy. The Prime Minister leads the cabinet. Parliament holds the government accountable.

### Is the polder model still tested on the KNM?

The polder model — the Dutch tradition of consensus-based decision-making through negotiation between government, employers, and unions — comes up occasionally. Know what it means: dialogue and compromise rather than top-down decisions. It explains why Dutch politics feels slow and process-heavy. It's by design.
