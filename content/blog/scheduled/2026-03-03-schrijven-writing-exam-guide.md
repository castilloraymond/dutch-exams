# Schrijven Exam Guide: What the Writing Test Actually Looks Like

The Schrijven (writing) exam tests whether you can produce short pieces of written Dutch for everyday situations — emails, form responses, short messages, and replies. You don't need perfect grammar. You don't need beautiful prose. You need to **communicate clearly enough to be understood**, hitting the key content points each task requires.

That distinction matters more than anything else in this guide. The Schrijven exam is not a grammar test. It's a communication test. People who write simple, clear Dutch that answers the question pass. People who write complicated Dutch with fancy vocabulary but miss what the task is actually asking? They fail.

Here's exactly what you'll face, how it's graded, and how to prepare.

## Exam Format at a Glance

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">35 min</div><div class="stat-label">For 4 writing tasks — roughly 8-9 minutes per task</div></div>

You sit at a computer at the DUO exam center. Each task appears on screen with instructions in Dutch (and sometimes a short scenario or context text). You type your response in a text box below the prompt. There's no spell-check. No autocorrect. No dictionary. Just you and a keyboard.

**35 minutes for 4 tasks is tight.** This isn't the exam where you have time to spare. You need to read the prompt, figure out what's being asked, write your response, and do a quick check — all in about 8 minutes per task. Planning how you'll use your time is part of the preparation.

## What Kinds of Tasks Appear?

Every task is rooted in a realistic everyday situation. The exam wants to know: can you handle basic written communication in Dutch life? Here are the task types you'll encounter.

### Task Type 1: Writing an Email

The most common task. You're given a scenario — you need to email your child's school about an absence, contact a landlord about a broken appliance, write to a colleague about switching shifts, or reply to an invitation.

The prompt tells you what to include. Something like: "Write an email to the school. Tell them your child is sick. Say which days your child will be absent. Ask what homework your child should do."

That's three content points. Hit all three, and you've done most of the work.

*Example prompt:* You received an email from your neighbor about a barbecue next Saturday. Write a reply. Say you'll come. Ask what time it starts. Ask if you should bring something.

### Task Type 2: Filling in a Form or Registration

You see a form on screen — a registration for a community event, a complaint form, a sign-up sheet for a language course. Some fields are simple (name, address), but others ask you to write a short explanation or describe something in 1-3 sentences.

The key here is reading the form fields carefully. If a field says "Reden van afmelding" (reason for cancellation), you need to write a clear reason — not just "ik kan niet komen" (I can't come). Be specific enough to answer what's asked.

### Task Type 3: Writing a Short Message or Note

A quick message to a colleague, a note for a housemate, a text message to a friend. These are the shortest tasks — sometimes just 2-4 sentences. But they still need to cover specific content points mentioned in the prompt.

*Example prompt:* Write a note for your housemate. Tell them a package arrived for them. Say where you put it. Say you won't be home tonight.

Three sentences. Three content points. Done.

### Task Type 4: Writing a Reply or Response

You're shown a short text — a message, an ad, a notice — and you need to write a response. This tests whether you can read, understand, and respond appropriately.

*Example prompt:* You see an ad for a second-hand bicycle. Write to the seller. Say you're interested. Ask about the condition of the bicycle. Ask when you can come see it.

The "reading + responding" combo makes this slightly trickier than the other types. Make sure your response actually addresses what was in the original text — don't write a generic message.

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key insight:</strong> Every task tells you what to include. The prompt is basically a checklist. Your job is to write Dutch sentences that cover each point on that checklist. Don't improvise. Don't add extra content that wasn't asked for. Hit the points.</div>

## How Grading Actually Works

This is where most people's assumptions are wrong. The Schrijven exam is **not** primarily graded on grammar. Here's what the examiners actually evaluate:

### Content (Most Important)

Did you cover all the points the task asked for? If the prompt gave you three things to write about, did you address all three? Missing a content point hurts your score more than any grammar mistake.

### Task Completion

Did you write the right type of text? If it asked for an email, does your response look like an email (greeting, body, closing)? If it asked for a note, is it appropriately brief? Matching the format matters.

### Understandability

Can a Dutch reader understand what you're trying to say? You don't need complex sentences. You need sentences that communicate your point clearly. "Mijn kind is ziek. Hij komt maandag en dinsdag niet naar school" is perfectly fine. It's simple, clear, and covers the content.

### Vocabulary and Grammar

Yes, they look at this. But it's the least weighted criterion. You can make grammar mistakes and still pass — as long as those mistakes don't make your text incomprehensible. Using "de" when it should be "het" won't fail you. Writing a sentence so garbled that nobody can figure out what you mean? That will.

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Write short sentences. Seriously. "Ik kan woensdag niet komen. Ik ben ziek. Kan ik donderdag komen?" is three simple sentences that are hard to get wrong and easy for the examiner to understand. A long sentence with three clauses gives you three chances to make a confusing error.</div>

## What the Computer Screen Looks Like

Knowing the interface removes one source of exam-day stress. Here's what to expect:

- **Top of screen:** Task number and time remaining
- **Middle:** The prompt/scenario in a box, with the instructions below it
- **Bottom:** A text input area where you type your response
- **Navigation:** Buttons to move to the next task or go back to a previous one

There's no formatting toolbar. No bold, italic, or bullet points. Just plain text. That's fine — your emails and messages don't need formatting.

You can go back and edit previous tasks if you have time left. The system saves what you've typed automatically. But keep an eye on that clock — 35 minutes goes fast.

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Watch out:</strong> There is NO spell-check or autocorrect on the exam computer. If you've been relying on your phone or computer to fix your Dutch spelling, you'll discover gaps you didn't know you had. Practice typing Dutch without autocorrect before exam day.</div>

## Strategies That Actually Work

### Read the Prompt Twice

The single biggest reason people lose points on the Schrijven exam: they miss a content point from the prompt. Read it once to understand the scenario. Read it again to count the specific things you need to include in your response. Some people underline or mentally number them — "okay, three things: say I'm interested, ask about the price, suggest a time to meet."

### Use Templates

At A2 level, emails and messages follow predictable patterns. Learn these patterns and reuse them.

**Email opening:** "Beste [naam]," or "Geachte heer/mevrouw,"
**Email body:** One sentence per content point. Simple. Direct.
**Email closing:** "Met vriendelijke groet," followed by your name.

**Short message opening:** "Hoi [naam]," or just dive in.
**Short message closing:** "Groetjes," or nothing — it's casual.

You don't need to reinvent the format for each task. The structure is always similar. Spend your brainpower on content, not format.

### Write in Simple Dutch

This isn't the place to show off vocabulary you're not sure about. Use words you know. Use sentence structures you're comfortable with. Subject + verb + object. Keep it basic.

Strong A2 sentences look like:
- "Ik wil graag een afspraak maken."
- "Mijn kind is ziek en kan niet naar school komen."
- "Kunt u mij vertellen hoe laat het begint?"
- "Ik heb uw advertentie gezien en ik ben geïnteresseerd."

Notice how none of these are impressive. They're all clear. That's what gets you points.

### Allocate Time Per Task

With 35 minutes and 4 tasks, you have roughly 8 minutes each plus a small buffer. Here's a workable split:

1. **Read prompt:** 1 minute
2. **Write response:** 5 minutes
3. **Quick review:** 1 minute
4. **Buffer:** remaining time for final check

If one task is giving you trouble, don't burn 15 minutes on it. Write what you can, move on, and come back if there's time left.

### Always Include a Greeting and Closing

For email tasks, starting with "Beste..." and ending with "Met vriendelijke groet" signals that you understand the format. It's easy points. Forgetting them makes your response look incomplete — even if the content is solid.

For casual messages, "Hoi" and "Groetjes" work fine.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Missing content points**

If the task says "ask about the price AND suggest a time," you need both. Writing a beautiful paragraph about the price but forgetting to suggest a time loses you a content point. The prompt is your checklist. Use it.

**Mistake 2: Writing too much**

More text doesn't mean a better score. Extra content that wasn't asked for doesn't earn bonus points. And it eats your time. Worse, more text means more chances for errors. Write enough to cover each content point. Stop.

**Mistake 3: Using English words when stuck**

If you can't remember the Dutch word, don't drop in the English one. Try to describe what you mean in simpler Dutch. Can't remember "stofzuiger" (vacuum cleaner)? Write "de machine om de vloer schoon te maken." It's clumsy, but it's Dutch, and the examiner can understand it.

**Mistake 4: Forgetting to check your work**

Even a 30-second review catches obvious errors. Did you answer all content points? Does each sentence make sense? Did you include a greeting? Quick wins that prevent easy point losses.

**Mistake 5: Panicking about spelling**

Some Dutch spelling is genuinely hard (double vowels, "-tion" vs "-tie," when to use "dt"). But spelling errors that don't affect meaning barely dent your score. "Ik kom morgen niet op mijn werk" is correct whether you accidentally type "kom" or "komp." Focus on meaning first, spelling second.

## How to Prepare: A Practical Approach

### Step 1: Learn the Task Formats

Before you practice writing, get familiar with what you'll be asked to write. Look at example tasks. Understand the types — emails, forms, messages, replies. Our [Schrijven practice module](/learn/schrijven) has tasks modeled on the real exam format so you can see exactly what to expect.

### Step 2: Build a Phrase Bank

Collect useful Dutch phrases for each task type and memorize them. These are your building blocks.

**For emails:**
- Beste [naam], / Geachte heer/mevrouw,
- Ik schrijf u omdat...
- Kunt u mij laten weten...
- Met vriendelijke groet,

**For requests:**
- Ik wil graag...
- Is het mogelijk om...
- Kunt u mij helpen met...

**For explaining situations:**
- Het probleem is dat...
- Ik kan niet komen omdat...
- Ik wil graag een afspraak veranderen.

**For responding to ads/notices:**
- Ik heb uw advertentie gelezen.
- Ik ben geïnteresseerd in...
- Kunt u meer informatie geven over...

### Step 3: Practice Timed Writing

Practicing without a timer teaches you to write Dutch. Practicing with a timer teaches you to write Dutch under exam conditions. Both matter, but the timed practice is what prepares you for the real 35 minutes.

Set a timer for 8 minutes. Read a prompt. Write your response. Check it. Repeat. Do this at least 10-15 times before your exam. You'll get faster at reading prompts, identifying content points, and producing clean responses.

### Step 4: Practice Without Spell-Check

Turn off autocorrect on your devices when practicing Dutch. Type on a basic text editor with no correction features. This shows you exactly which words you've been relying on your phone to spell. Better to discover those gaps now than during the exam.

### Step 5: Get Feedback

If you have a Dutch-speaking friend, colleague, or tutor, ask them to read your practice responses. Not for grammar corrections — for understandability. "Could you figure out what I was trying to say?" That's the question that matters.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to use perfect grammar to pass?

No. The exam prioritizes content and understandability over grammar. You can make mistakes with "de/het," verb conjugation, and word order — as long as a Dutch reader can still understand what you wrote. Write simply. Write clearly. Don't chase perfection.

### Can I use a dictionary during the Schrijven exam?

No. No dictionaries, no phones, no notes, no translation apps. You work with the Dutch you've got in your head. That's why building a phrase bank beforehand is so valuable — those memorized structures carry you through.

### What if I can't think of a Dutch word?

Describe it in simpler Dutch. Can't remember "verhuizen" (to move house)? Write "Ik ga naar een nieuw huis." It's not elegant. It works. The exam rewards communication, not vocabulary range.

### How long should my responses be?

There's no strict word count, but most good responses are **3-6 sentences** for emails and replies, and **1-3 sentences** for short messages and form fields. Write enough to cover the content points. Don't pad it.

### Is the Schrijven exam harder than Lezen or Luisteren?

It's different. [Lezen](/blog/lezen-reading-exam-format-scoring) and Luisteren are passive — you read or listen and pick from options. Schrijven is active — you produce Dutch from scratch. Many professionals find producing Dutch harder than understanding it. But the grading is forgiving, and the tasks are short. With practice, most people find Schrijven very manageable.

## Your Next Steps

The Schrijven exam rewards preparation and simplicity. You're not writing a novel — you're writing the kinds of short messages you'll actually send in Dutch daily life. Cover the content points, keep your sentences clean, and manage your 35 minutes well.

Here's your action plan:

1. **Try sample tasks** — work through our [Schrijven practice module](/learn/schrijven) to experience the real format
2. **Build your phrase bank** — memorize 15-20 useful sentences for emails, requests, and short messages
3. **Practice timed writing** — 8 minutes per task, no spell-check, 3-4 sessions per week
4. **Review the full picture** — read our [complete exam guide](/blog/inburgering-exam-guide-professionals-2026) to see how Schrijven fits with the other five components
5. **Plan your schedule** — use the [30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) to balance Schrijven prep with your other exam components

You already write emails and messages every day in English. The Schrijven exam is the same skill, just in simpler Dutch. The format is predictable. The grading is fair. You've got this.
