# How to Get Permanent Residence in the Netherlands: The Complete Roadmap

You've been living in the Netherlands for a while now. You've figured out the healthcare system, survived your first King's Day, and can even navigate the Albert Heijn self-checkout in Dutch. At some point, a thought crosses your mind: *maybe I should make this permanent.*

Getting permanent residence — a **verblijfsvergunning voor onbepaalde tijd** — is one of the most important bureaucratic milestones you'll hit in the Netherlands. It means you can stay indefinitely, switch jobs without visa stress, and stop worrying about whether your employer's IND sponsorship will lapse.

But the path to PR isn't as straightforward as "live here long enough." There are specific requirements, timelines, and — here's the part most people don't expect — you almost certainly need to pass the **inburgering exams**.

This guide walks you through every step, from figuring out which route applies to you all the way through the IND application. No guesswork, no vague advice. Just the roadmap.

## What Permanent Residence Actually Gets You

Before diving into the how, let's talk about the why. What does a PR permit actually change?

With a temporary residence permit (bepaalde tijd), your right to stay in the Netherlands is tied to a specific purpose — your job, your partner, your studies. Lose that connection, and your permit can be revoked. PR removes that dependency.

**What PR gives you:**

- **Unconditional right to stay** — no more renewals, no more employer sponsorship requirements
- **Freedom to switch jobs** without notifying the IND or needing a new work permit
- **Access to social benefits** on the same terms as Dutch citizens
- **Stronger legal position** — the government can only revoke PR in extreme circumstances (fraud, extended absence from NL)
- **Pathway to citizenship** — PR isn't required for naturalization, but it demonstrates long-term commitment

**What PR does NOT give you:**

- Voting rights in national elections (that requires citizenship)
- A Dutch passport
- Automatic right to return if you leave the Netherlands for more than 12 consecutive months

<div class="takeaway-box"><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> PR is about security and freedom. You stop being a "guest" in the Dutch system and become a permanent participant — with almost all the rights of a Dutch citizen, minus the passport and national voting.</div>

## The Core Requirements: What You Need for PR

The IND (Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst) evaluates PR applications against a specific checklist. Miss one item, and your application gets rejected — along with the €210 application fee. So let's be precise about what's needed.

### 1. Five Years of Continuous Legal Residence

You need **five uninterrupted years** of legal residence in the Netherlands on a non-temporary purpose. This is the big one.

A few things to know:

- The clock starts from the date on your first residence permit, not your arrival date
- **Short trips abroad don't reset the clock** — you can travel for holidays and business
- **Extended absences can be a problem** — if you leave the Netherlands for more than 6 consecutive months, or more than a combined 10 months within the 5-year period, the IND may not count those years
- Time spent on certain permit types doesn't count — student visas and au pair permits, for example, only count at 50%

**Which permits count fully toward the 5-year requirement?**

| Permit Type | Counts Toward PR? |
|---|---|
| Kennismigrant (highly skilled migrant) | Yes, fully |
| EU Blue Card | Yes, fully |
| Family reunification / family formation | Yes, fully |
| Paid employment (regular work permit) | Yes, fully |
| Self-employed | Yes, fully |
| Study / student visa | 50% (2 years on student visa = 1 year toward PR) |
| Au pair | 50% |
| Asylum (after status granted) | Yes, fully |
| Search year (zoekjaar) | Depends on subsequent permit |

### 2. Passing the Inburgering Exams (Civic Integration)

This is the requirement that catches the most people off guard — especially kennismigranten who were told they're "exempt" from inburgering.

Here's the distinction that matters: you might be exempt from the **mandatory inburgering obligation** (meaning DUO won't send you a letter with a deadline). But for the PR application, the IND requires proof that you've passed the inburgering exams or an equivalent. There is no exemption based on your visa type.

**What you need to pass:**

Under Wi2013 (which applies to most voluntary inburgeraars, including kennismigranten):

- **Lezen** (Reading) — A2 level
- **Luisteren** (Listening) — A2 level
- **Schrijven** (Writing) — A2 level
- **Spreken** (Speaking) — A2 level
- **KNM** (Knowledge of Dutch Society)
- **ONA** (Orientation on the Dutch Labour Market) — or proof of sufficient integration into the labour market

Pass all six components, and you receive the **inburgeringsdiploma**. That diploma is your golden ticket for the PR application.

<div class="stat-box"><div class="stat-number">6</div><div class="stat-label">Exam components needed for your inburgeringsdiploma — the key unlock for permanent residence</div></div>

**Alternatives to inburgering:**

The IND accepts some alternatives to the inburgeringsdiploma:

- **NT2 Staatsexamen I or II** — a higher-level Dutch language exam (B1 or B2). If you've passed this, you can substitute it for the four language components. You'll still need KNM and ONA.
- **Dutch-language secondary or higher education diploma** — if you completed education in Dutch, you may be exempt from the language requirement
- **Age exemption** — if you've reached Dutch pension age (AOW-leeftijd), you may be exempt from the language exams

For the vast majority of expats, the standard inburgering route is the most practical path. The exams are at A2 level, which is significantly more achievable than you might think. More on that below.

### 3. Sufficient and Stable Income

The IND needs to see that you can support yourself financially. The exact threshold is tied to the **minimum wage** and depends on your household situation.

As of 2026, the approximate thresholds are:

| Situation | Monthly Gross Income Required |
|---|---|
| Single person, no children | ~€2,070/month |
| Single parent | ~€2,070/month |
| Married/partner, no children | ~€2,950/month |
| With children | Varies (higher) |

Your income must be from "durable" sources — typically a permanent employment contract or a fixed-term contract with at least 12 months remaining. Self-employed applicants need to show consistent income over the past several years, usually through tax returns.

**Important:** the IND looks at your income, not your partner's. If you're applying for PR, *your* employment situation needs to meet the threshold.

### 4. No Serious Criminal Record

The IND runs a background check. Serious offenses can disqualify your application. Minor traffic violations won't be an issue, but convictions for fraud, violence, or drug offenses within the past few years will likely result in a rejection.

### 5. Valid Travel Document

You need a passport that's valid at the time of application. Expired passport = automatic rejection, so check your expiry date before you apply.

## The Different Routes to PR

Not everyone takes the same path. Your starting visa type shapes the timeline and specific requirements. Here's how the main routes work.

### Route 1: Kennismigrant (Highly Skilled Migrant)

This is the most common route for expats working at international companies, startups, or Dutch multinationals.

**Timeline:** 5 years from your first kennismigrant permit

**Key points:**
- You're exempt from mandatory inburgering, but you still need the inburgeringsdiploma for PR
- Your 30% ruling status doesn't affect your PR eligibility
- If your 30% ruling ends (after the maximum 5 years), your kennismigrant permit continues — they're separate things
- Start preparing for inburgering exams in year 3 or 4 so you're ready to apply at the 5-year mark

**Common mistake:** Waiting until year 5 to even think about inburgering. The exams take time to prepare for and schedule, and DUO exam slots can fill up. Start early.

### Route 2: EU Blue Card

The EU Blue Card is similar to the kennismigrant route but follows EU-wide rules.

**Timeline:** 5 years of continuous residence with the Blue Card

**Key points:**
- Similar income and education requirements as kennismigrant
- Time spent in other EU countries on a Blue Card may partially count (under specific conditions)
- Same inburgering requirement as kennismigranten

### Route 3: Family Reunification / Family Formation

If you came to the Netherlands to join a partner or family member who already lives here, your path to PR follows this route.

**Timeline:** 5 years from your first family permit

**Key points:**
- You likely have a **mandatory** inburgering obligation with a deadline (usually 3 years from your permit date)
- The mandatory obligation and the PR requirement overlap — passing the exams satisfies both
- If your relationship ends before you get PR, your residence situation becomes complicated. Get legal advice if this applies to you.
- Income requirement typically evaluated based on your sponsor's income initially, but for PR you may need to show your own income

### Route 4: Regular Employment

If you have a regular work permit (not kennismigrant), the route is similar but your employer needed a TWV (tewerkstellingsvergunning) for you.

**Timeline:** 5 years

**Key points:**
- Same inburgering and income requirements
- Your permit is more tightly linked to your specific employer than a kennismigrant permit
- After 5 years and PR, you're free to switch jobs without any work permit considerations

### Route 5: Self-Employed

Entrepreneurs and freelancers can also get PR, but the income verification is more demanding.

**Timeline:** 5 years

**Key points:**
- You'll need to demonstrate consistent income through accountant-verified financial statements and tax returns
- The IND may request a statement from the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO)
- Same inburgering requirement

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Regardless of your route, start the inburgering process at least 12-18 months before you plan to apply for PR. Exam scheduling, retakes (if needed), and DUO processing times can eat into your timeline fast.</div>

## The Timeline: From Arrival to PR

Here's what a realistic timeline looks like for someone on a kennismigrant visa who plans ahead.

**Year 1-2: Settle in, pick up basics**
- Get comfortable with life in the Netherlands
- Start casual Dutch learning if you haven't already — apps, classes, conversations
- No urgent inburgering action needed yet, but awareness helps

**Year 3: Start inburgering prep**
- Begin structured study for the inburgering exams
- A [30-day focused study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) can get you exam-ready if your Dutch is already at a basic conversational level
- Register on [Mijn Inburgering](https://inburgeren.nl) with DigiD
- Take some [practice exams](/try) to assess your starting level

**Year 4: Take the exams**
- Schedule and sit for all six exam components through DUO
- Each component costs around [€48-€51](/blog/inburgering-exam-costs-2026) per attempt
- If you fail a component, you can retake it (at the same fee per attempt)
- Receive your inburgeringsdiploma once all components are passed

**Year 4.5-5: Apply for PR**
- Gather all required documents (see IND application section below)
- Submit your PR application to the IND
- Pay the €210 application fee
- Wait for processing (typically 6-9 months, but can be longer)

**Year 5+: Receive PR**
- If approved, collect your new residence card (verblijfsdocument) showing "onbepaalde tijd"
- Congratulations — you're a permanent resident

<div class="warning-box"><strong>Watch out:</strong> The IND's processing time for PR applications has been increasing. In 2025-2026, applicants are reporting wait times of 6-12 months. Apply as soon as you're eligible — don't wait for the last minute.</div>

## Inburgering: The Key That Unlocks PR

Let's zoom in on the inburgering requirement, because this is where most of the actual work happens.

### What Level Do You Need?

If you fall under Wi2013 (most kennismigranten and voluntary inburgeraars), you need **A2-level Dutch**. This is the CEFR framework level described as "basic user" — you can handle routine tasks, describe your immediate environment, and understand short, simple texts.

A2 is not fluent. It's not even intermediate. It's the level where you can read a supermarket flyer, understand a simple email from your child's school, and have a basic conversation about your daily life. Achievable? Absolutely — even with a full-time job.

### The Six Exam Components

| Component | Type | Questions | Time | Pass Mark |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lezen** (Reading) | Multiple choice | ~25 questions | 65 minutes | ~60% |
| **Luisteren** (Listening) | Multiple choice | ~25 questions | 45 minutes | ~60% |
| **Schrijven** (Writing) | Written responses | 4 tasks | 40 minutes | ~60% |
| **Spreken** (Speaking) | Recorded responses | 4 parts | ~20 minutes | ~60% |
| **KNM** | Multiple choice | 40 questions | 45 minutes | 70% |
| **ONA** | Portfolio/proof | N/A | N/A | Pass/fail |

You can take the exams in any order and on different dates. Many people knock out KNM first (it's knowledge-based, not language-dependent), then tackle the language exams.

### Study Strategy

The most efficient approach for professionals:

1. **Assess your current level** — take a [free practice exam](/try) to see where you stand
2. **Build a study plan** — a focused [30-day study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) works well if you're already at A1 level
3. **Practice with real exam formats** — DUO exams follow a consistent format. Knowing what to expect removes half the stress. Try our [reading practice](/learn/lezen/exam) or [KNM practice](/learn/knm/exam)
4. **Schedule strategically** — book your strongest component first for a confidence boost, then tackle weaker areas
5. **Budget for retakes** — most people pass on the first try with good preparation, but having a financial buffer for one or two retakes is wise

### ONA: The Component Everyone Forgets

ONA (Oriëntatie op de Nederlandse Arbeidsmarkt) is the orientation on the Dutch labour market. For people with jobs — which includes most kennismigranten — this is usually the easiest component to satisfy.

If you're employed in the Netherlands, you can typically prove ONA compliance by showing:
- An employment contract
- Recent pay slips
- A letter from your employer

You don't need to take a separate exam. But you do need to submit the proof as part of your inburgering file, and forgetting this step can delay your diploma.

## The IND Application Process

Once you have your inburgeringsdiploma, it's time to apply for PR. Here's the step-by-step.

### Step 1: Gather Your Documents

The IND requires:

- **Application form** — download from IND.nl or use the online portal
- **Valid passport** — with at least 6 months validity remaining
- **Proof of 5 years continuous residence** — your residence permit history, which the IND can partially verify themselves
- **Inburgeringsdiploma** — or proof of exemption/equivalent
- **Proof of income** — employment contract, recent pay slips (usually 3 months), employer declaration (werkgeversverklaring)
- **Proof of health insurance** — basic Dutch health insurance (basisverzekering)
- **Passport photo** — meeting Dutch biometric photo requirements
- **Proof of payment** — €210 application fee (as of 2026)

### Step 2: Submit the Application

You can submit your application:
- **Online** through the IND portal (recommended — faster processing)
- **By post** to the IND office
- **In person** at an IND desk (appointment required)

After submitting, the IND sends a confirmation letter with your case number.

### Step 3: Biometrics Appointment

The IND will invite you for a biometrics appointment at an IND desk. They'll take your fingerprints and a photo for your new residence document. This usually happens within a few weeks of application submission.

### Step 4: Wait for the Decision

The IND has a legal decision period of **6 months** for PR applications. In practice, processing times vary:

- Straightforward cases (employed kennismigrant, all documents in order): 3-6 months
- Complex cases (self-employed, gaps in residence, pending inburgering): 6-12 months
- If the IND needs additional information, they'll contact you — respond quickly to avoid delays

### Step 5: Collect Your Residence Document

Once approved, you'll receive a letter inviting you to collect your new verblijfsdocument. This card will show your residence purpose as **"onbepaalde tijd"** — permanent residence. It's valid for 5 years as a physical document (though the right itself is permanent), and you'll need to renew the card before it expires.

## Costs: The Full Picture

PR isn't free. Here's what the complete journey typically costs:

| Cost Item | Approximate Amount |
|---|---|
| Inburgering exam fees (6 components) | €290-€300 total |
| Possible retakes (1-2 components) | €48-€51 each |
| Study materials / course | €0-€500+ |
| IND application fee | €210 |
| Biometric document | Included in IND fee |
| Passport photos | €10-€15 |
| Travel to exam centers | Varies |
| **Total estimate** | **€500-€1,100** |

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you have a mandatory inburgering obligation (common for partners of kennismigranten), you may be eligible for a DUO loan that covers exam fees and course costs. This loan is interest-free and may even be partially forgiven if you pass within the deadline.</div>

## Common Mistakes That Delay Your PR

After talking to hundreds of people going through this process, these are the mistakes that come up again and again.

**1. Waiting too long to start inburgering**
The single most common mistake. People assume they'll "get to it eventually" and then find themselves in year 5 with no diploma and a 6-month exam backlog.

**2. Confusing "exempt from mandatory inburgering" with "don't need inburgering"**
Being a kennismigrant means DUO won't chase you. It does not mean the IND will waive the requirement when you apply for PR. These are different systems.

**3. Not checking exam availability early**
DUO exam slots, especially for popular locations like Amsterdam and Rotterdam, can book up weeks in advance. Check availability and book early.

**4. Forgetting about ONA**
You passed all five exams, you're celebrating... and then realize you never submitted your ONA proof. No diploma without it.

**5. Letting your passport expire**
A surprising number of applications get rejected on this technicality. Check your passport expiry date well before applying.

**6. Leaving the Netherlands for too long**
A three-month trip home to visit family is fine. A six-month sabbatical abroad might reset your residency clock. Track your absences carefully.

**7. Not saving financial documentation**
The IND wants to see proof of stable income. If you switched jobs or had a gap in employment during the 5-year period, have explanations and documentation ready.

## After PR: What's Next?

Once you have permanent residence, you might start thinking about Dutch citizenship. PR isn't a requirement for naturalization (you can apply for citizenship after 5 years of residence even without PR), but the processes overlap significantly.

**Citizenship (naturalization) requires:**

- 5 years of continuous residence
- Passing the inburgering exams (same as PR)
- Renouncing your current nationality (in most cases — there are exceptions)
- No serious criminal record
- Valid residence permit at the time of application

The biggest decision point is usually the nationality renunciation. The Netherlands generally requires you to give up your current passport, though exceptions exist for certain nationalities and situations. This is a deeply personal decision that deserves careful thought.

If you've already obtained PR and passed inburgering, the citizenship application is relatively straightforward — you've already met the hardest requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I apply for PR before 5 years?

In most cases, no. The 5-year continuous residence requirement is firm. Some exceptions exist for long-term residents in the EU who accumulated residence in multiple EU countries, but these are rare and complex.

### Does time on a student visa count?

Partially. Time on a student visa counts at 50%. So if you studied in the Netherlands for 4 years before switching to a work permit, that counts as 2 years toward your 5-year requirement.

### What happens if my PR application is rejected?

You'll receive a written decision explaining why. Common reasons include insufficient income, incomplete inburgering, or documentation issues. You can appeal the decision or reapply once you've addressed the issue. The application fee is not refunded.

### Can I lose my permanent residence?

Yes, but only in specific circumstances:
- Leaving the Netherlands for more than 12 consecutive months
- Obtaining PR through fraud
- Being convicted of certain serious crimes
- Voluntarily giving up the permit

Normal travel and vacations don't put your PR at risk.

### Do I need to speak Dutch after getting PR?

Legally, no — there's no ongoing language requirement after receiving PR. But practically, having A2 Dutch (which you proved by passing the exams) makes daily life significantly easier. Many PR holders continue improving their Dutch after the exams.

### My partner and I both need inburgering — can we study together?

Absolutely. In fact, studying together can be more efficient and motivating. Just be aware that if your partner has a mandatory obligation, their deadline may be different from your voluntary timeline. Make sure you're both clear on individual deadlines and requirements.

## Your Next Steps

The path to permanent residence is a marathon, not a sprint. But it's a marathon with a clear finish line and well-marked checkpoints.

Here's what to do right now:

1. **Figure out your timeline** — when did your 5-year clock start? When will you be eligible?
2. **Assess your Dutch level** — take a [free practice exam](/try) to see where you stand
3. **Build your study plan** — our [30-day inburgering study plan](/blog/30-day-inburgering-study-plan) gives you a structured path
